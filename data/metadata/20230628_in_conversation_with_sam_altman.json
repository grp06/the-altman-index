  "description": "Together with AI Singapore (AISG), IMDA recently hosted an exclusive \"Conversation with OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman\", as part of OpenAI's visit to Singapore. As AI continues to impact society profoundly, it was timely to hear Sam’s thoughts on how there will always be a place for AI to embrace global values, the unique preferences of each country, their culture, language and hopes for the future. Our special thanks also to Rachel Lim, Member of Technical Staff, Open AI for joining us and Dr Leslie Teo Senior Director, AISG for facilitating the conversation on how AI and humanity are evolving in tandem.\n\n#IMDA #IMDigitalArchitect #OpenAI",
