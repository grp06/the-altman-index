  "description": "You know him as the CEO of OpenAI — but did you know that Sam Altman is an avid writer? \n\nAs one of today’s most successful entrepreneurs, Sam champions the tremendous value of writing: how it clarifies your thinking, expands your ideas, and levels-up your life in every sense, both personally and professionally. Plus, he has a love for the creative. (Have you ever met someone who can recite Percy Bysshe Shelley poems from memory? Well, Sam can.) \n\nIn this episode, we discuss how Sam uses ChatGPT in his daily life; how LLMs are changing the future of writing; what it means to be a novelist in the age of technology; and Sam’s best-learned writing lessons from Paul Graham. If you want to learn how the king of ChatGPT writes, this episode is for you.\n\nSPEAKER LINKS:\nWebsite: https://openai.com/\nBlog: https://blog.samaltman.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sama\n\nWRITE OF PASSAGE: \nWant to learn more about the final class for Write of Passage?\nhttps://writeofpassage.com/\n\nPODCAST LINKS: \nWebsite: https://writeofpassage.com/how-i-write\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-i-write/id1700171470\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2DjMSboniFAeGA8v9NpoPv\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n00:00:00 Introduction\n00:01:36 Will LLMs change how we write?\n00:03:22 Human-computer interaction\n00:08:39 How does Sam use ChatGPT?\n00:11:26 How Sam shed his anxiety\n00:13:00 How clear thinking leads to clear communication\n00:17:24 Sam once dreamed of being a novelist\n00:18:37 What Peter Thiel taught Sam about thinking\n00:21:35 What Paul Graham taught Sam about writing\n00:24:00 How much of Sam’s writing comes from conversation\n00:26:02 The book Sam Altman wants to write\n00:28:37 Sam’s Advice for Founders and Y-Combinator Applications\n00:30:20 How Y-Combinator Influences OpenAI\n00:30:43 What Excites Sam About Writing with ChatGPT\n00:33:45 How Sam Decides What to Work On\n00:35:55 How Sam chose to work on AGI\n00:37:35 Writing strategy memos at OpenAI\n00:38:38 The skill you need in the age of AI\n00:39:53 Does writing education need to change?\n00:41:34 Why isn’t ChatGPT a better storyteller?\n00:44:20 Sam’s obsessive note-taking method\n00:46:06 The Future of Writing in an AI World\n00:47:12 Will AI put writers out of work?\n\nABOUT THE HOST: \nI’m David Perell and I’m a writer, teacher, and podcaster.
