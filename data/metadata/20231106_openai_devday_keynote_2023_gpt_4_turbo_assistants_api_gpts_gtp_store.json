  "description": "At its inaugural developer conference DevDay, OpenAI unveiled major upgrades like GPT-4 Turbo, a more advanced AI model that's 3x cheaper than GPT-4 and a 128k token context window that can handle much longer prompts. They also launched new multimodal capabilities so developers can integrate vision, speech, and image generation into apps. Key highlights include the Assistants API for building AI agents, the ability to create custom versions of ChatGPT called GTPs and share them publicly on the GTP Store, and Copyright Shield to protect customers. Overall, OpenAI aims to make AI more affordable, capable, and safe for developers to build next-gen apps.\n\nSponsor:\n• GO.ACILEARNING.COM/TWIT",
