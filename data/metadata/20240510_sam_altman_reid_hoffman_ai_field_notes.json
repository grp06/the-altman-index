  "description": "Greylock general partner Reid Hoffman talks with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman about their mutual learnings from the AI tools released to date, primarily GPT-4 4 (https://openai.com/product/gpt-4) , OpenAI's language model that co-wrote Hoffman's recent book “Impromptu (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYG9V1RN/) .\" Keeping up with all the AI advancements – and questioning both the pros and cons of their immediate impact – is why Hoffman wrote Impromptu. As he describes, the book is intended to act as a travelog of his experience with GPT-4. Above all, he sees AI as a human amplifier, but urges it must be developed safely. Safety is exactly what OpenAI is striving for, Altman says, and Hoffman’s detailed chronicle of his experience with GPT-4 is exactly the kind of data the organization needs to continue developing the technology with safety in mind.\n\n\nYou can read a transcript of this conversation here:\n\n\nhttps://greylock.com/greymatter/ai-field-notes/\n\n\nYou can access Impromptu for free here:\n\n\n https://www.impromptubook.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/impromptu-rh.pdf\n\n\nAnd on Amazon here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYG9V1RN/\n\n\n \n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
