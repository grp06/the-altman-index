  "description": "This video is an edited version of the full interview / fireside chat style q&a with Mosaic Ventures partners Simon Levene and Mike Chalfen and Sam Altman..\nfull interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKpmHoJfO5g\n.published nov. 2016.\n\nI put this together to make it easier to watch (many studies show subtitled videos get more plays)\nAnd I wanted a little more streamlined video for people who are focused mainly on the listed topics since the full was 97 minutes long.\n\nSam Altman, being president of Y Combinator, and co-founder of Open AI along side Elon Musk, are just some his many, many accolades and notable influential roles. As he's at such a young age, I feel we all should be fairly in tune with his mindset since he's literally helping shape our worlds future more than most people. And being that he's such a kind, generous, and intelligent lad, I'm extremely proud to get the chance to be alive in the time that people like him are helping lead the way. It doesn't take much time listening to him to realize there's very few individuals like him.\n\nI spent probably too much time on this video, but figured it can serve as like a nice tribute to Sam for all of his contributions to society.\n\nGranted, I also think when we're friends, he may critique the fact that I spent all this time on subtitles instead of that time on building my companies, but, it's still seems like my time invested in this was worth while, just so long as you take the time to watch, apply, and pass it on as well :)\n\nCONNECT WITH CALEB:\nhttp//:www.calebbrandalise.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/calebbrandalise\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/calebbrandalise\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/calebbrandalise\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/calebsbrand\nSnapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/calebbrandalise\nMedium: https://medium.com/@calebsbrand\nSoundcloud: https://www.soundcloud.com/calebbrandalise\n\nFOLLOW OCDeli\nhttps://www.ocdeli.com \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ocdeli\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ocdelivegan\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/ocdeli\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/18210212/\nTumblr: https://www.tumblr.com/ocdeli",
