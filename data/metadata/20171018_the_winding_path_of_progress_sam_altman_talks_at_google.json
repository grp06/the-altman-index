  "description": "Sam Altman is the president of Y Combinator, the most prestigious startup incubator in Silicon Valley, but his vision for humanity's future goes far beyond northern California. \n\nSince taking the helm at Y Combinator, Sam has spearheaded the creation of new initiatives like YC Research, a nonprofit branch of Y Combinator that aims to conduct pure research into moonshot ideas like universal basic income, as well as OpenAI, a nonprofit AI research company working on creating a path toward artificial intelligence that can benefit all of humanity. Sam visits the Mountain View office to share his thoughts on a wide range of topics, including bias in the workplace, the most underrated quality of successful startup founders, the potential benefits of nuclear fusion, the growing challenge of economic inequality, and the role of the tech industry in politics.\n\nModerated by Jorge Cueto.",
