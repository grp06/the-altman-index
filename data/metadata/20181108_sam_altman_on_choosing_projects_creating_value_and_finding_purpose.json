It\u2019s hard to overstate how important this is, and how bad most people are at it. http://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short\n\n3:20 \u2013 Stepping back and evaluating your work\n\n5:00 \u2013 Creating metrics for your projects\n\n6:00 \u2013 Taking a year off\n\n9:00 \u2013 Figuring out when to commit\n\n11:00 \u2013 Poker\n\n12:00 \u2013 From Productivity \u2013 Sleep seems to be the most important physical factor in productivity for me. Exercise is probably the second most important physical factor. The third area is nutrition. http://blog.samaltman.com/productivity\n\n14:30 \u2013 From You and Your Research by Richard Hamming \u2013 If what you are doing is not important, and if you don\u2019t think it is going to lead to something important, why are you at Bell Labs working on it?\u2019 http://blog.samaltman.com/you-and-your-research\n\n16:00 \u2013 From The Days Are Long But The Decades Are Short \u2013 Things in life are rarely as risky as they seem. Most people are too risk-averse, and so most advice is biased too much towards conservative paths. http://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short\n\n17:00 \u2013 Perspective shifts\n\n19:45 \u2013 From Productivity \u2013 My system has three key pillars: \u201cMake sure to get the important shit done\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t waste time on stupid shit\u201d, and \u201cmake a lot of lists\u201d. http://blog.samaltman.com/productivity\n\n22:00 \u2013 What Happened to Innovation http://blog.samaltman.com/what-happened-to-innovation-1\n\n24:20 \u2013 From You and Your Research by Richard Hamming \u2013 He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important. http://blog.samaltman.com/you-and-your-research\n\n26:20 \u2013 The deferred life plan doesn\u2019t work\n\n31:20 \u2013 From The Merge \u2013 Our self-worth is so based on our intelligence that we believe it must be singular and not slightly higher than all the other animals on a continuum. Perhaps the AI will feel the same way and note that differences between us and bonobos are barely worth discussing. http://blog.samaltman.com/the-merge\n\n33:40 \u2013 Weight training\n\n35:00 \u2013 The Way to Love by Anthony de Mello https://www.amazon.com/Way-Love-Meditations-Anthony-Classics/dp/038524939X",
