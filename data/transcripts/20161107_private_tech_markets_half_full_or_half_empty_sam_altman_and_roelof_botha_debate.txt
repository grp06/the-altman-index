Unknown: they were slow to get to smartphones. gain a foothold in the smartphone ecosystem, for example. So Sam, you see more
Sam Altman: Because it is always about a particular investment and not not the general thing. Like when people say, well, you know, valuations for series a rounds are too high as a general statement. I I understand the underlying belief there, which is that everything is overheated, but I think there are always really good investments to make. At Y Combinator, we don't move our terms up or down in good times or bad times. We always just stay at the same terms. So we're where we were three years ago, seven years ago, and I I think we'll be in the same roughly the same terms adjusted for inflation in terms of the dollars that we give a few years from now. the startups that you want are the most disruptive ones that are surfing these giant changes. And I think what people are sensing but not correctly articulating is that maybe we just have less giant changes happening right now than we did in 2009, When someone says an investment is really overpriced, they're usually either really right or really wrong. there is a bubble. There is a and because of well, don't know why people aren't paying attention, but for whatever reason people are transferring the interest rate bubble to the startup bubble. And the trick when you say an asset class is overpriced is that there's always a denominator. It's it's always, I would rather hold US dollars or start up equity and here's what I think the relative value is. And and I think that, this is I don't think they go away until But I I think that people the reason that people have been so wrong for so long about calling the end is because there's this massive counterweighting thing of you can't get a return on capital in any risk free way. And so it has been flooding into any just sloshing around looking for anywhere it can maybe get a return. And you see things like people who normally would leave after their first few investments didn't work,
Unknown: former unicorns will slowly die, you know, meltdown will slowly happen and there'll be a rebirth of some other really new interesting companies.
Sam Altman: You know, I feel a little bad that I fell for that it takes more intelligence than I have. raise more money and take more dilution earlier on than they normally would or that I would normally advise because because of longer term risk. And I didn't really believe it, but I got caught up in it and said it anyway. And that was probably a little bit bad, but it's at least the safe direction to be wrong in. I think what we're looking for though, and what Y Combinator, sometimes to our detriment, always tries to look for is companies that can get profitable if they need to without being dependent on outside investors. So we're always excited for companies to raise money and spend it to grow faster and get bigger more quickly. But we'd like companies that aren't dependent on that because then you really are at the whims of This I think actually is the key point in terms of what people have been getting wrong this cycle. Mhmm. I wrote maybe a year or a year and a quarter ago, wrote this post called unit economics. And it was about how the thing that people are getting wrong is that they have these businesses that are growing, but without a miracle change, we'll never make money. And I posted it like I'd post any other thing without a lot of thought and went to bed. And I woke up the next morning with like a 100 emails from YC founders saying, I need to meet you urgently. We're never gonna work. And I I didn't, until that experience have a sense for how many companies were making this mistake. Mhmm. But I think for me that has been the special signature of what's gone wrong in this cycle. The the one thing I would add as a consequence of that is because there's so much money available and because so many of these businesses don't have or at least at the early days, have an obvious network effect or competitive advantage, you got into these crazy price wars where you're doing this service, it kinda like makes a little bit of money, but then a competitor of yours raises $50,000,000 And you can reverse that, but it's hard. But that's a consequence of
Unknown: retail e commerce, I mean they have consistently grown faster than e commerce as a whole and if you look at the internet retailer top 100 e commerce companies, Amazon has consistently grown faster than any of them despite being the largest. So there's these incredible economies of scale and scope that they have as a business and then the cloud offering is by far the market leader today. So I think they have an incredibly good shot. Google obviously has its tentacles in many interesting businesses. Google can leverage capabilities that Amazon may not have. I think they have much better machine learning and AI capabilities at Google that may end up being really interesting value added services that propel their cloud business.
Sam Altman: but what I would say, and this is from a completely uneducated point, not having looked at any of these companies financials in detail, my intuition is there's not a single one of them. Back to this idea that there's always a denominator. There's not a single one of them might be willing to short against the S and P. Because I think they're all not overvalued relative to other companies or relative to equities in general.
Unknown: may end up with an ability to raise money private at IPO level pricing without the attendant negatives of being a public company. And so, you know, to predict. I
Sam Altman: The and I think that there are advantages to being public and advantages to being private, and it's hard to say in general if going public is better or worse than staying private. I I think it really depends on the specific company. My one controversial thought on this, everyone talks about the liquidity can be plenty of good reasons to stay private and maybe that's worth more in some cases and you should prefer that. Mhmm. can get away with it if you are if you get yourself to the point where you are one of the tech mega caps. And then you can led by a strong founder who is willing to be misunderstood by Wall Street for a long period of time. But most founders I know unfortunately are far more affected by their upgrades and downgrades and stock price and analysts than you would like to believe.
Unknown: swallowed our pride and took an IPO price that was lower than the last private valuation we had and proceeded I think. As a financial services firm, there's so much inside the company that's run like a public company anyway because you're subject to scrutiny from state regulators and so the additional burden of being public is not actually that much more.
Sam Altman: in many cases, there's that was not nearly the worst of the behavior, but that that definitely has an effect, especially when it's a company acting with very imperfect information that is making a public statement. It's not a market. Right? Because it's not a lot of people saying, here's what we think the price is. It's one person with imperfect data saying, here's this random thing. So I I think my my working model for a lot of early stage capital has been it's more like debt than equity, but there are some caveats to that. And that causes, you know you know, an investor portfolio manager to be willing to agree to one set of terms even if then an accountant says, well, if I look at this equity and ignore those terms because these things could happen, I value it at this. But in any case, what we have seen among our companies is a very healthy market at the early stage, a very healthy market at the super late stage, a Stripe, an Airbnb, something like that, and a less investors playing in the kind of call it 300,000,000 The sign of an unhealthy market is if no unicorns are dying, in my opinion. And I think it would be healthier to see more companies dying. And, you know, I make fun of people that have been calling for the deaths of the unicorns for years, but I would like to see some. I think it'd be health like, it's weird to me that Do you keep track at y c of like failure rate? I think We do. We do. A We are not taking enough risk and we're missing the companies that could be really huge. I don't know what the problem is, but I do know at the stage we fund companies, I feel good looking today, but, The thing that really excites me about it is well, don't even like probably honestly, y c goes up head to head against Sequoia for a growth deal. will sometimes, but I wouldn't say we're gonna do that every time. The thing I'm most excited about and the thing that I think when people look back will say, they're happy why C did that. We fund a lot of companies that look deeply unpopular to the current investment climate. That require huge amounts of capital. Like what? Nuclear fusion companies, quantum computing companies, synthetic biology, rockets, supersonic airplanes. And my biggest criticism of the Silicon Valley investment environment is that people don't think critically enough about unpopular sectors that are important to the world and also phenomenal investment opportunities. And Because it works so well, there's no need to get really good at it. it's really important to me personally that y c fund companies like this. And I realized that if we were not able to backstop them with large amount of capital large amounts of capital once they were doing really well, there are many fields that require more training. Experience, I think, often cuts both ways. Sometimes it's really good, And sometimes it you know, I've heard many people that run very successful companies say, if I had experience, if I was not an idiot, I never would have started this. And so there are different fields where it matters more or less. We certainly have higher internal standards in in different fields for how much experience and expertise we require. On the other hand, the counterbalancing factor to our average age is I am astonished at this point how many qualified experienced 18 year olds are starting companies. You know, people there are 18 year olds that have been programming for ten years that could go get a job as a, you know, not entry level engineer at any Silicon Valley Tech company they wanted. And so you've seen that shift on the other side.
Unknown: mobile phones over landline telephones because the legacy infrastructure wasn't there, and so mobile phone adoption was unbelievable. I had better cell phone coverage in South Africa fifteen years ago than I have today in The US. And so, similarly, it feels like China is leapfrogging and you have all these consumers that are just embracing the Internet and they're not beholden to the past ways of shopping or doing business, you know, whether it's some of these, you know, the Singles Day shopping
Sam Altman: usually respond respond to to that that with with the advice I give investors, which is a good specific deal, you should still do it. And so the advice I give to companies is because most of the questions people most of the question companies ask about are what's going on in the fundraising environment right now? How should I adapt my pitch for this particular fundraising environment? And and my advice is this is not about the fundraising market. This is about you as a specific company and convincing this investor that the terms you want or that this is a good risk adjusted investment. And the answer to most founders questions about how to hack fundraising is have a good company. And all of the effort that people put into jujitsu, I think would be better reallocated to making a really great company. And and I have seen this so many times where a founder puts all this effort into, you know, telling their story and getting the company ready to rates and all of that, and goes off and tries to raise money and can't raise any. And then somewhat dejected figures out how to make it work with the money they have, and gets the company looking like this, profitable, growing, whatever. No longer needs money because they're profitable and growing, and then they have the same investors that passed on them a year ago with really good reasons about, you know, deep insights about why the business wasn't going to work, you know, desperate to invest. And so I think it's a little bit ridiculous to say, but the answer is make your company really good. Sounds good to me. Well The word that came to mind for me was authenticity.
Unknown: What is the eureka moment that gave rise to this idea? And why is what they have a compelling solution to the problem sustainable way. That's what I look for. And having that conversation and dialogue is far more interesting than having my eyes glaze over with 25 slides and, you know, a rehearsed pitch. Yeah. Authenticity.
