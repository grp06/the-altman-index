Sam Altman: pitch practice. This is something that we invented by accident a couple of years ago. One of our speakers had to cancel at the last minute, so we just threw together this idea. Let's bring up some startups. This is NYC. We've never done it on stage before. But the idea was, you know, a lot of people they've gone through YC, it's coming up to demo day and actually they've never had a real experience like pitching an investor just like cold, someone who doesn't know anything about them. So we got this idea, hey, let's just try it out, you know, have a founder come up, give their pitch. And just to warn you, they're usually like pretty rough, that's kind of the point of it. and probably 95% of startups are a bad investment. So you kinda get in a mode where you're just a default no. Right? And it's a very it's a little bit cold because, know, people are pouring off their hearts and they're putting all their dreams into it. But, you know, nine times out of what you're looking for is like why are you the exception. Right? So it's not good enough just to be like, oh, that sounds like a nice business. I have to think like, wow, this is that one business, that one that I've been saying no for months, but today I'm gonna say yes. So just to just to kind of frame it for you. Alright. First up. So, I'm not actually pretending that I didn't bother to
Unknown: and we help agricultural energy and mining companies hire ships. And just to be clear, I'm not talking about containers. I'm talking about full ships. So you are a commodity trader. You need to shift 50,000 tons of coal from South Africa to Rotterdam,
Sam Altman: and you come to us to find that ship. I see. So I took a position on coal in South Africa, and then I'm like, uh-oh. No. I've gotta get it someplace else. And what would I do today? I I don't know anything about this business. So Today, you would pick up your phone and your email, and you would call five to 10 brokers I see. So this is like a marketplace where right now these brokers and they what do they take a big cut and then you're gonna like, what's the value proposition for me as as a trader? So think about it like this. Today,
Unknown: what you're speaking to all these different brokers, it can take you three to twenty four hours to get some indications back. It can take you up to two weeks to actually book that ship. With Shipamax, we use satellite technology and navigation to cover every ship on Earth, and we can tell you which ship can make it in time and fit the specifications and is open in seconds. it's like a a very binary thing as a commodity trader, and you need to know what your delivered price is to the customer. Otherwise, someone else can come come and get that deal instead of you. And both myself and my cofounder have lost multimillion pound deals for not getting freight fast enough. And the second proposition is really service. Would you rather speak to five brokers and receive thousands of emails for per deal, or would you rather say, this is my shit. Let's go. our beta about seven weeks ago. And since then, to see if they would talk to us and give us requests. To date, we've had about 4,500,000 worth of requests. And last week was largest energy trading companies in the world. They shift a 150,000,000 tons of products annually. it's we're still competing with other brokers right now. The revenue potential was 15,000,000 annually. Our goal is to make this much, much faster, like, help us get there. So they're giving us a go. They want smarter intelligence, and the smaller companies want better access to the market. So today, we're just saying, yeah, it's not all perfect out of the box right now, but Right now, basically, what our problem has been is that we need a bit more funding to get more men on the ground to help fulfill these requests. Because right now, some of the larger brokers have better intelligence. And so we're starting kind of from zero, and each time, we're kind of getting closer and closer to actually booking that deal and and beating the brokers. So it's a huge market. So today, like, the the amount that these traders spend on brokerage fees today is about $3,000,000,000, at least, at current market low rates. The largest company today is a company called Clarksons who make 214,000,000 GBP per annum. I think what's kind of what's interesting that's happening is that the problem with these big guys, like, they are superior to the small brokers. Right? They have more intelligence, and they can serve bigger clients better. But who they can't serve is the little guys, and and
Sam Altman: obvious for me and familiar to most of us is, like, the real estate market. Right? Like, Redfin or someone was gonna come in and just blow away the brokers. But so far, it seems like I don't know if I've seen any of that those markets. It seems like the brokers are very good at holding on to their position.
Unknown: and so we're not a pure technology play. We're enabling our brokers to be much smarter than anyone else. And the cool thing about this market is that intelligence is the main driver. Traders reward their brokers with deals based on intelligence because you need that intelligence to keep getting good rates. So if you can build a platform that is the the only thing that can aggregate and digest this, like, explosion of information at scale.
Sam Altman: You're the only one person that can scale speak to these small companies and the big companies and mine all that data to actually serve people more effectively than anyone else. Okay. So supposing I do believe all of that and that, like, there is gonna be this one tech company that just manages to displace all of the brokers. Mhmm. Why should I believe it's you?
Unknown: So our team combines, like, a few things. I won stock up experience in actually growing businesses, two very experienced brokers on team as well as people who have been on the trading side of this market, as well as deep technical talent. And and I think you need all those things, and it's it's very difficult. People people in this industry generally don't know anything about technology. It's a very old industry. And people who understand technology generally don't understand, like, the niche things that you need to care about when shipping 50,000 tons worth of commodities. Have you shipped a lot of commodities?
Unknown: So hey, Paul. I'm Sam from Shipimax. Shipping is still 9% of world GDP. It's one of the biggest markets people don't think about, and it hasn't moved forward much with technology. But still more than half of all cargo doesn't get shipped that way. And is there has been no winner that's emerged for a Uber like shipping experience where basically you click a button, you say I need to ship from here to here, you get a rate, you get a boat and it goes. So that's what we're building. And the the standard broker fees are like 15%. And so we think this is, you know, really large market. broker fees on cargo shipping is a $150,000,000,000 a year market. But there is a natural monopoly in that, like any other marketplace, the the the people that have cargo wanna go where they can get the cheapest rate and the most options, and the people that have boats wanna go where the most people that need something shipped are. And so even though no one has brought software to this industry yet, and it's been this sort of network of people calling,
Sam Altman: you know, brokers calling around to to ships they know. Why haven't one of these existing brokers just eaten up the market?
Unknown: Well, why do why does any industry not adopt software? I think there's a great quote I heard recently that it is harder for existing companies to get good technology people than it is for good technology people to learn about other industries. And this is why startups have an opportunity. This is why Is is that the only way that you can eat the industry then? Is that I I mean, it's just naturally fragmented if you don't have software. Is that is that your theory? Well, yeah. I think it's like any other industry. It's like Airbnb couldn't have worked without software. You just have people call around and find vacation homes that happened to be free or you had to call taxi companies before Uber and find a cab that was free. The magic of software is just that any of these industries can become centralized on one platform that gives everybody a central experience. And in these large markets, these platforms tend to be winner take all or winner take most and create super valuable companies. One one of the secrets that we've learned as we've been working on this business, and we're very new. We're only seven weeks old. We still have a lot of things left to figure left to figure out. But one of the things that we've learned is most people are either And what you need is the combination. You need humans aided by software. This is just like PoundTier or how PayPal dealt with fraud. And this is what customers want. So we're actually gonna have a bunch of brokers that customers can talk to on the phone like they're used to, but we'll give them software that makes them a 100 times or a thousand times more efficient. But you're totally right. And the reason other people have failed doing this is they don't understand this, and they just have a pure software platform. And it really is the combination of of humans and software together that makes this still work with customers that have been doing it for a long time, but have the advantages of a software company in scale. So is this working right now? Do you have a lot of customers? So we're super early. We don't have haven't been able to raise any money yet. We're only seven weeks old. In that seven weeks, we've been able to get 50 people that have sent us jobs. We don't yet have enough infrastructure in place to fulfill those, but we expect to actually book three boats next week and we'll make our first $10,000 of revenue. What we know is coming in our pipeline to get to a $100,000 in revenue. And that's not GMV or anything like that. That's actual profit that we're gonna keep. We have nearly a 100% margin on that. And then what are your expenses? will be paying the the brokers salary and and commissions. But again, I wasn't joking when I said I think we can make them a 100 times more efficient with software. You would not believe how broken the industry is today. It would it would pain you to watch how one of these brokers works. So we think there's still And Is that gross? But, you know, like,
Sam Altman: do I believe it's you and not some other
Unknown: we ourselves used to have to do this a lot. And we understand a lot of the things that most people don't. We're commodities traders. We've shipped huge amounts of goods. And and we we've learned these non obvious things. Like, the most important thing for a a commodity trader is not the price, but the speed and the certainty. So it's really important to know if you're going to trade on a raise razor thin margin that you can have a ship on a particular day at a particular cost before you buy the coal or whatever.
Sam Altman: Should we talk about it a little bit or should Yeah. Yeah. Kinda short on time. But if there's anything quick. Quick recap. I mean, so this is one where it's a business that I don't know anything about. So there's there has to be, like, a pretty strong educational component to to start with. And so it definitely, you know, helped especially that you're able to give, like, some high level overview. fundamentals of, like, what drives the business. Because for me, like, my default assumption about the world is that 99% of people will want to just keep doing the same thing that they do day after day unless they have no choice. And so, like, chains happens when people are like pushed. And so like the commodities trader with the margins where it's like he he's gonna lose money if he doesn't get the right ship or whatever. Like that makes sense. Right? Because it actually becomes like a competitive thing where the people who adopt the technology in one I I I'm I'm having trouble wrapping my head around. So is this is this something that I as a patient want or or is it something for doctors? Who who's the customer? you shouldn't have to answer legal questions then. You should have it figured out already. I see. So I've got all of that in advance. So so once I have this, I walk into the doctor's office and I say, hey. Good news. I've got, my purple folder here. And then the doctor says, that's awesome. Or like, like, does it work if the hospital or like medical facility I go to does not yet have your software or do they have to be like,
Unknown: So health care in The US is horrible. We spend 19.5% of our GDP on it, and we have the lowest satisfaction of any developed nation. And you might wonder why that is.
Sam Altman: I mean, I think there's like no underlying economic model other than driving the cost higher fundamentally.
Unknown: patients have data on six or seven different systems. They have prescriptions. They have appointments. They have communication with doctors. Most people can't use all the systems or one. And so we've just tried to make one consumer portal for all your medical records and any other medical data you have. If you have this, can actually understand your care or a family member's care and actually have a much better experience and hopefully over time drive the cost way down. In the process, we become one central repository for all patient health data that actually works. one particular scary story from a friend of mine was a missed message about a potential cancer screen. But it's usually something like that. It's someone gets really sick or something bad happens because of a lack of information and communication.
Sam Altman: And so the pitch to me as a consumer is that this brings together all of my information
Unknown: it's so that you can get better care. Like the the issue, many people taking care of a sick parent or grandparent have run into the issue where they don't know what to do. You know, the patient doesn't remember something or the family member doesn't remember something. And, the idea is like these are complicated things. You'd really like to have a single set of information that says, here's when you need to take these medications, here are these test results, you have to go in to get this test, this doctor said this thing, wants you to tell his other doctor. It really is just about, you know, better care. And people are willing to pay an unlimited amount of money if they can get that actually to be good. Are they paying you an unlimited amount of money right now? So we've just started charging. We, unlike most healthcare companies, don't want to drive the cost of healthcare up and up and up. Kind of hate it when people say, oh, I make this medical device for $7
Sam Altman: at an early stage, that you'd be able to be focused. So, you know, if you can say, yes. It's that. But here's the part that's really exciting is it grows bigger. But I I need to be able to wrap my head around it. Otherwise, it's it's almost like it's like a Christmas tree. Right? You wanna, like, hang the ornaments off. But without the tree, like, it's just ornaments smashing on the floor. So, like, I need to have that that, like, concrete framework in my head first. Like, So, the the first thing I ran into is just, like, unsure what the product is.
Unknown: Me too. I it's always so tempting to try to tell this sort of grandiose and exciting story. But if you can't if the person you're pitching can't understand what you actually do today in the first like thirty seconds, the pitch is unlikely to get better from there. And so just like saying it in plain language, just what the product actually does, what a user can do, who your customer is, what they pay you for, and what your product does is super important. Yeah. And in fact, this is the once you're in YC,
Sam Altman: this is the first thing that we work on. And so it's not easy. Like, it takes the companies in YC usually about a month to get it right. So every time we meet with them in regular office hours or especially we have a thing called group office hours, the very first thing that each company has to do is give me their one line description.
