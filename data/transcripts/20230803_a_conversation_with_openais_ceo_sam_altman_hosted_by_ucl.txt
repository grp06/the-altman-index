Unknown: We have a fantastic panel, and we are actually taking questions from the floor, really almost from the outset. So please be ready. There are a few roaming mics kicking around, I will I will choose you as as I spot you. When it comes to questions, obviously, it's a really So let's start with the introduction to our really, really fantastic panelists. Next to her, David Barber, professor David Barber, is the head of the AI Artificial Intelligence Center here. And next to me is Margaret McCabe, who is an entrepreneur and a philanthropist who is focusing on education. So it's a wonderful panel. Thank you for the three of you for joining us. And there is so much from the previous session. I wanted to start perhaps with a question for the panel, which is as you three educationalists in a sense, you look at what you have seen over the last six months, what is the one thing that you would like to offer to OpenAI
Unknown: Well, I run Debate Maids. I set it up. I found it. I'm a barrister. I'm not like, I'm not a scientist whatsoever. I'm here representing humanity. And is to make excellent education available across the world to everyone everywhere. AI turned up. I said, this is exactly how we're going to start across Africa, and and we're gonna take it from there. So, basically, what we do, we teach basic skills drawn from British debating, which sounds a bit, like, obtuse and far out there, but it works. We've been doing it for fourteen, fifteen years. And being a human, you have to have the skills we teach. So artificial intelligence is not real, It's not that intelligent. Human intelligence dictates, dictates what's going on in AI. And what we've noticed is that you need these human skills. So what we do at DebateMate, we make better humans. We have to have better humans. Intelligence is one of those evocative words that's a little bit intimidating because people either see themselves as intelligent or not intelligent. creativity, critical thinking, and resilience. We can teach those skills to the people who are writing the programs.
Unknown: about the the fact that it seems very exciting, but but perhaps not so exciting within, traditional academia? I mean, how important is maintaining
Unknown: Margaret, please. It's really good for learning difficulties, dyspraxia, dyslexia. We know that it's amazing and can help kids to read and write. I'm really impressed with Sam admitting that America's made a mistake about this. Because once you could admit a mistake, that's an adult skill, right? And that's where the innovation happens. So I think And the EU is passing widespread human skills, these transferable skills, resilience, critical thinking, communication, which includes listening and speaking, how to work strategically in a team, how to be empathetic and compassionate. These will be these skills that we teach will are now moving very fast to the center of mainstream education. And so many learned people say that these are the skills we apps everyone absolutely needs to learn. If you're asking about hard skills, about what careers, you know, we're still gonna need doctors, and we're gonna need dentists and lawyers. But I think as Sam said, the science is gonna go ahead so fast, and we're gonna progress so fast that the actual content
Unknown: Okay. Great. I can I can put those two questions together? So the first question really is about the business model, right, and how you imagine the the the the business of OpenAI to to to expand through the API? We'll take the second question in a second.
Sam Altman: Yeah. We we wanna make the platform that people like the most for intelligence. We we wanna have, like, intelligence as a service that gets smarter and smarter and better and better and cheaper and that people plug it in once. We'll probably change the format of the API a little bit over time. We can make it more stable. Can do a bunch of other things. I think there are some versions of superintelligence that absolutely are alignable and controllable and can build safety systems around. I mentioned like one vision for it earlier that I think is workable. But there's ways in which people control systems smarter than them all of the time. Like, I feel much better. Like, these are systems that can express themselves in language and we can have them do it in small steps that we can understand. They can help us understand our thing. So I feel very good about kind of our part to nudge the AI revolution in one direction, but it could get nudged back into one that I don't feel as good about for sure. I'm again, pretty happy though with where things are. Is the world
Unknown: Sam, that's a really future positive, note to bring
Unknown: just in closing out, let me just say what a fascinating afternoon it has been, full of fascinating insights and some diverse thoughts, It's been fantastic for me. I think just to pick out one thing that I would reflect on when Sam was chatting with Azim and talking about the future of work. I think he emphasized the hope that in future, empower people in many areas of the world, but it would also improve and enhance the status of human to human interactions and the work that involved that. For me, that really resonated because as a university, as a community, that's, of course, one of the things we do every day, whether it's educators inspiring the next generation, innovators creating the next innovation, researchers thinking about everything from what it means to be human to how to create the next technology. And, of course, it's what we've been doing here this afternoon, coming together as a community, interacting, talking with each other, and discussing these really important issues. And I'm really grateful, to Sam for the leadership he's showing in that space by coming here today. We're gonna close now. You're gonna leave by that door over there, please, where the sunlight no no Mars and no funds tax is gonna happen out there. The sunlight is waiting for you. But in closing, may I just say how proud UCL is to have hosted this OpenAI event with Sam Altman, Azim Azar. May I thank all of you for your attention and your questions, our wonderful panelists,
