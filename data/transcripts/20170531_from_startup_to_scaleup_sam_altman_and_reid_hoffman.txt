Reid Hoffman: kind of a funny set of accidents. First, Sam had this brilliant idea of teaching a startup class at Stanford topic, but this is actually a good topic for essentially our network and for the businesses because you really only build something amazing if you hit the scale problem. And if you fail, you fail. So it's public. Anticipate that being public. The hallway conversations are private, so don't tweet So with that, one of the key things that I think is interesting is you say, Well, why is it that Silicon Valley tend to tell ourselves still classically this kind of startup story of, well, we're inventive and we have venture capital and we import a ton of talent here and the venture capital stuff all works, but actually in fact it's the fact that we intersect technology invention with business invention, where that business invention includes such things as network effects, new business models, and so forth. And then in seeing those, in the Valley all say network effects as something super important. do this, is occasionally when I'm feeling impish,
Sam Altman: impact companies as we can, which is really why we started our own growth stage fund. where we are advising 3,000 startups at once. I think this is probably a world record for number of startups concurrently advised by one program. And next year we think we can scale that to 10,000. And so for us, get to the most promising new founders at the very start of their career thinking about a startup, get the best ones of those into our program,
Reid Hoffman: And so classically, too much of the advice that's given to entrepreneurs is, like for example, when you're 20 people, hire your scale executives so that when you're at thousands and so forth, you have all those people baked and in place. And very rarely are the right people that when you're executives at 20 or 50, are the right people for executives when you're a thousand or 500. but A players at this stage are not necessarily the same as A players in the next stage, and you have to be, one, managing your connectivity with those folks in a way that if you're promising this person that they're going be head of product or head of sales or head of marketing or head of engineering forever, you will actually have a seriously important role in this organization forever. You will be a major contributor. you move from doers to manager doers to managers and doers to managers of managers, otherwise execs. Right? That's changing the whole dynamic. So you have to anticipate in scale that you're changing around the way that your company actually works
Sam Altman: that that will be coming. I had a funny example of this late last year. Someone was writing a story about YC and they wrote something about how we just had our second major reorg in two years. And I read that as, oh, they're saying we're not moving fast enough. And they meant it as way too chaotic. And it's this and I stand by my read of it. But I think like the the amount of dynamism that the the startups that really scale well have always looks a little chaotic on the outside. It's just because there's constant shuffling of new people in and people who aren't working out out. The very best founders that we've worked with, one of the things that they always evaluate their people on is how good have they been at training their replacements? How good are they at you know on a moment's notice being able to move to a next role? Because most to how good of a job they were doing at having replacements ready to go and being ready to move into a new role. And I think if you don't really incentivize it, you never get enough of that culture in place.
Reid Hoffman: there will be chaos. We're trying to constantly manage it, but we don't manage to zero chaos until we're actually in a relatively stable place. And so expect that, work collaboratively with each other, and make that happen. That's one part of the correlation. So it's not just external looks at chaos, it's internal chaos. No, it really is chaotic. And you have to just
Sam Altman: the wrong way to address that is to like say, okay, my team says they don't want chaos. the trade off, you know, people that run these perfectly non chaotic organizations somehow never build great companies. Yes. So so the trade off is we're gonna accept a little bit of chaos
Reid Hoffman: The second part, and this is one of the really key things that I learned from my first startup. This was kind of a classic entrepreneurial mistake. It's called SocialNet. I kind of approached this with what you know, actually. was optimizing for that. The other parts of the learning and adjusting is the whole organization is going to change shape. And so if you don't optimize a host. And so this is actually part of when I got to PayPal and was kind of when Peter and Max and I were going on walks about how to first build what was first called FieldLink, then Confinity, then PayVal.
Sam Altman: the problem with most executive recruiters is that they reverse that order. Yep. As your and so if you say I need to hire a CFO, they will go bring you people with you know twenty years of experience as a CFO at vaguely similar companies. But unfortunately it's usually like twenty years of the exact same year of experience over and over again and they probably can't learn and adapt Speaking of YC continuity, Ollie, who runs our continuity fund, you free yourself from this sort of the traditional model of how you hire executives in a non growing, static company and think that in a blitzscaling company you have to flip the the priority of skills, you end up or the priority of attributes. You end up with a very different team, but it's the one that works. And the very best companies take this exceptionally far in
Reid Hoffman: from when Sean Parker and Zuckerberg hired Kohler from LinkedIn, we're hiring a really smart generalist. And that was actually one of the things that really helped set the initial talent team and culture as it scaled. It was that kind of thing about thinking which are the things that you most need to solve and then getting the generalists into it. Because one of the things that you do need to eventually, as you scale, hire specialists, but the theme that you look at as you move from startup to scale up is you always have generalists. The generalists are important for learning, changing the organization, adapting, adapting product market fit, tackling new markets, going global, etcetera. But you still very selectively add in the specialists. When you have someone who says, look, I am just kind of a network engineer, you're like, okay, great. That's when we know that what we need from you is network engineering part of the that was our learning from social and another of the We have a great I recently did I'm doing this podcast series on Masters of Scale where I asked him, I said, Look, there's two theories of thought in Silicon Valley. One theory is that culture eats strategy, and that culture is the dependent thing for how you really build great companies. And then the other theory is that actually culture is the historical explanation for successful companies. Right? That when you have a successful company, you look back and say, that culture, that was really great. But I do think that the theory that's pro culture is that, again, when you look at the traits of you're gonna be moving up at such a fast rate that you're going be having chaos, you're going to be reorganizing fairly consistently. And as you reorganize, especially managerial roles, Because if your only culture is top down hierarchy and messaging and communications that comes from the top, that culture won't survive as you really balloon the organization. Instead, you want a horizontal accountability. You want it so that everybody is keeping everyone else accountable to the culture that we're in. And cultures are not like there is the good culture and the bad culture. Cultures are defined by an organization. Some cultures are engineering cultures. Some cultures are high IQ cultures. Some cultures are collaborative teamwork cultures. The problem is that it doesn't just end there. You actually do have to play good strategy and everything else. So the thing that when people frequently sell culture too much is they say you have good culture, everything else follows because you hire the right people, you play the right way together. And that's of course extremely important, but if you don't get the business model and the strategy
Sam Altman: The the general framework that I think about when net effect on the output vector of the organization. moderately intelligent and moderately productive but have a hugely positive impact on what they get everybody else to do. And I think like one version of culture is are you good at only bringing are you good at bringing in people that have a positive net effect on the output vector? Which screens out sort of just looking at people in a vacuum. I think though that it's really easy to sort of use we're we're super nice to each other, and we have this wonderful culture. And they don't understand why people don't want to come work there or come and leave and aren't productive. And the answer is the culture that matters I think to the best people is one where they can just come and be really productive and be around really other great people. And if you have a culture which is which looks good on the surface but somehow rejects super talented people or is just it's covering up for constant infighting, I think that can be a real problem. things going on in the current 2017 Silicon Valley is it's very easy to get entitled employees. It's very easy to get entitled people at a company. get lower. And so you know this idea of how important it is to have people that are going to join a company and stay there for five or ten years sounds like a crazy thing to say because no one does that anymore. That's really important. But but getting people who are there for that and not there for the green tea, which is like an I think an easy way people
Reid Hoffman: for for this is actually, in fact, I think too few organizations following what Hastings did in terms of creating a culture deck. Now the thing that's interesting is is that the reason this deck got there, and I actually think every company should do some version of that and some version of publishing it. forever. We're actually a team, and and do that immediately. People say, wait, wait, thought I was joining a family. And they said, okay, well let's define what it is. And they wrote it and they said, well, how do we shape the funnel of people coming in? Well, let's publish it. And then, of course, after publishing it, it actually really helped a whole bunch of people understand like, oh,
Sam Altman: this is a worthwhile exercise and it's good to do but only to the extent that what you say is different from what other people would say. Yeah. And trying to figure that out is really important and what honestly what most companies find when they do this or what many companies find is that they have nothing to say that wouldn't be in sort of
Reid Hoffman: filter what would have a players working at other companies than yours? Which a players do you not want working at your company? And what is that? And that when I was talking to this, I think he and Dave Duffield interviewed everybody up to 500 because they were the final culture interview. They presumed that everyone had done the skills and other kinds of things and they were the are you the right fit? And that's super important. But your hiring changes as you scale. more. Like one thing as you begin to get from the, call it, the hundreds into early hundreds and the late hundreds, you'll actually start having onboarding classes, like when you say, okay, we hire people and then all 15 people start at the same day so that we train them on our company in the same pattern in order to make that efficient and so forth. And that's part of this whole hiring process. So you also not only have to think about org, but also how you're hiring, what's the way you're doing it, and that itself I'm gonna shift topics to communications within the company. Classically, you're at an early stage, Then you begin to build, and part of that is that begins to shift to everyone has a complete dialogue to be on the same page. And you have to start changing the pattern at which information is being both expected and communicated. at Google, And that begins to get too much and so forth. And so then they moved to selling birthday celebrations per month. Everyone whose and now
Sam Altman: Certainly when you get to the stage where people that were used to knowing everything don't know everything, that
Reid Hoffman: what I did is I arranged a regular lunch with some of those key contributors in kind of some different lunch groups and just where we had lunch and could talk about the company. So they still felt that they had an
Sam Altman: He used to spend or still does spend like 20 of his 30 nights a month taking key Airbnb employees that don't report him out to dinner. And I think like that level of commitment, like I'm gonna take 20 of my 30 nights a month and use it to sort of keep close to early people who otherwise sometimes feel out of the loop is huge. The other thing on communication that people get wrong as you scale,
Reid Hoffman: The other key thing is to decide when you really need to hit the gas because part of what the blitzscaling stuff is, you actually deploy capital in a fast and inefficient way in order to get to scale and or global scale. And sometimes that's competition, sometimes that's market opportunity, sometimes that's critical mass density in networks. But one of the key things is what are the different judgment points at which you're hitting the accelerator on scale and then trying to anticipate that in good ways. And there's those tend to be the variables in what you think about it, but that's another thing to think about in the scale arena. So with that
Sam Altman: hire reasonably slowly? Or are we in the mode where we got things to work and we know what to do and we are now going to like spend money at an unreasonable rate and have everyone say the same thing. But this like are we in hyperscale mode or not?
Reid Hoffman: Another is the question, generally speaking, changes of mission are really bad, so the mission should also be there. So to some degree, everyone is we're in service of the mission, not we have this role in a specific organization. And then, generally speaking, changes to strategy are very expensive. They frequently happen, pivots, etcetera. But it tends to be the this is the investment thesis instead of hypotheses that we're testing out. What tends to not be as much as is like, okay,
Sam Altman: is not winning fails is because without that, then all of these problems of people having their turf stepped on and you know the occasional bad hire you have to get out, people have a lot of time to like think about how unhappy those things make them. And if things just keep getting better and there's like more opportunity than you can possibly take on and that everyone constantly has like new expanding roles and so they don't get caught up in these turf wars, then it works. But I think this is one of the reasons it's so important to not flip into hyperscaling mode until you're pretty sure the product is working. Because without without this natural updraft of like a market that is desperate for your product and a feeling that like everyone is winning every day and the company is doing just fantastically well,
Reid Hoffman: business where you're actually in fact working on efficiency. focused on operating margins and how costs work and how scale works and everything else in a capital efficient model, And frequently, one of the questions that can be in consumer Internet especially, enterprise needs to identify this earlier than consumer. Consumers sometimes will overly obsess with operating margins early when it's actually in fact get to scale, then obsessed with operating margins. Because if you're not at scale, your operating margins don't matter, that can make the brutal change a little easier.
