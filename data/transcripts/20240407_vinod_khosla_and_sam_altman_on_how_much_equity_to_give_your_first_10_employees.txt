1: I see this as a major problem nowadays. People aren't allocating equity widely enough. I think among the first three or four founders at Sun, we kept less than half of the common. The total was something like 25 to 27% for the founders, an equal or slightly larger chunk for everybody else we would hire. And then investors had minority, but a significant minority. So it was like he was more than worth it because he helped attract Eric Schmidt. I don't think Eric would have come work for me as a 25 year old. And so full circle back to equity, as much as leaving 30% of the pool to nonfounders. So Neil kept 15%, hired a cofounder for 15%, and then left the rest to hire great employees. Now
0: points. So why would I ever pay like five x or 10 x? being super generous with early employee equity and getting founder quality people as the first 10 employees,
