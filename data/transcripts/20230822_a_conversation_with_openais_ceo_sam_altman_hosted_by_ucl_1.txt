Unknown: We have a fantastic panel, and we are actually taking questions from the floor, really almost from the outset. So please be ready. There are a few roaming mics kicking around, questions. And if we can just keep phones turned off again, at least on silent So let's start with the introduction to our really, really fantastic panelists. You, of course, everyone knows Sam. And next to me is Margaret McCabe, who is, an entrepreneur and a philanthropist who's focusing on education. So it's a wonderful panel. Thank you for the three of you for joining us and there is so much from the previous six months, what is the one thing that you would like to offer to OpenAI
Unknown: I'm here representing humanity. And Fabulous. This is our chance. My aim, my ambition is to make excellent education available across the world to everyone everywhere. we're gonna take it from there. So, basically, what we do, we teach basic skills drawn from British debating, which sounds a bit, like, obtuse and far out there, but it works. We've been doing it for fourteen, fifteen years. And what we've noticed is that you need these human skills. So what we do at DebateMate, we make better humans. We have to have better humans. Intelligence is one of those evocative words that's a little bit intimidating because people either see themselves as intelligent or not intelligent.
Unknown: And I think it's a really good interface to start with. But I think what we can offer OpenAI from a human computer interaction perspective is different ways by which to design that interface to radically change how we do things and carry out our activities. So we might like to combine multimodal interfaces, but we can also think about AR and other technologies that are out there and how we can combine these. And also good old fashioned graphical user interfaces, so that it's not just a chat box, but there are different ways in which people can interact, whether it's teams of people or individuals, whether it's young children or very old people. I think that's what we can offer you is that we do lots of research in that area.
Unknown: about the the fact that it seems very exciting, but but perhaps not so exciting within, traditional academia? I mean, important is maintaining On that point about a global compact,
Unknown: we're very concerned in education at universities and schools about students using ChatGPT to do their assignments, to do their exams, and the worry is there, what should we do about it? Do we need new regulation? And I don't think we We're not there yet, but I think we definitely need to have those discussions about how much do we regulate or how much do we embrace these new technologies and change the way in which we teach and assess. And I think there needs to be important debates about the specific types of governance.
Unknown: Margaret, please. It's really good for learning difficulties, dyspraxia, dyslexia.
Unknown: the the the business of OpenAI but this is a question of control. Yep. Sam, that's a really future positive note to
Unknown: just in closing out, let me just say what a fascinating afternoon it has been, full of fascinating insights and some diverse thoughts It's been fantastic for me. I think just to pick out one thing that I would reflect on when Sam was chatting with Azim and talking about the future of work. I think he emphasized the hope that in future, not only would AI empower people in many areas of the world, but it would also improve and enhance the status of human to human interactions and the work that involved that. For me, that really resonated because as a university, as a community, that's, of course, one of the things we do every day, whether it's educators inspiring the next generation, innovators creating the next innovation, researchers thinking about everything from what it means to be human to how to create the next technology. And, of course, it's what we've been doing here this afternoon, coming together as a community, interacting, talking with each other, and discussing these really important issues. And I'm really grateful, to Sam for the leadership he's showing in that space by coming here today. We're gonna close now. You're gonna leave by that door over there, please, where the sunlight, and no funds tax is gonna happen out there. The sunlight is waiting for you. But in closing, may I just say, how proud UCL is to have hosted this OpenAI event with Sam Altman, Azim Azar. May I thank all of you for your attention and your questions, our wonderful panelists, Azim, but, of course, Sam Thank you very much.
