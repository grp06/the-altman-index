Unknown: nitty gritty of company, startup company building stuff. YC is a very product focused incubator, probably the most product focused incubator around. Strapline being make something people want. The hacker dream of building a piece of software that you launch out through Product Hunt and Hacker News and that then grows into a large company like some of the YC companies like Dropbox and Stripe have done. To what extent is that a reality these days? And how frequently do you see that happening versus companies coming in and building sales teams from the get go?
Sam Altman: startup that didn't have a product that people love so much, they proactively told their friends about. And and so I think no amount of growth hacking, no amount of sales funnel optimization will save you if you don't fundamentally build a great product. And so but because that's really hard, everybody looks for alternatives. And the advice no one wants to hear is go make your product better. People always want some sort of trick. They wanna believe like, if I can just unlock the secret to email marketing or PR or something else, then I'll be great. And that stuff is important. You you do need to kind of jump start the whole effort to some degree. But I think it's so easy to blame the cause of things not working on anything except a great product that people try every alternative. So I think everything you've said is important and we do try to teach founders about that. But the thing that we really try to do is find people who are going to build great products and then help them do that. And I think that is more important. That is to a first approximation, you cannot succeed without a great product, no matter how good you are at everything else. If you have a great product, you can still fail, but those other skills seem easier to tack on. Where
Unknown: have you seen the right balance between the artisanal development team who focus on what they view to be the great product but perhaps don't get the and those the danger if you focus relentlessly on products, of course, you potentially never leave the house with it.
Sam Altman: teams drive through? Well, I I think it's impossible to build a great product without a lot of contact with your customers. So I have I have never I know it's theoretically possible, but I have never seen a team go lock themselves in their flat and come out two years later with a fully formed, incredible product that people love. I think you need the constant feedback cycle with then and one company has a cycle time of a month and one company has a cycle time of a day, you end up in wildly different places a year out. And so, I think if you look at some of our most successful companies, Airbnb and Stripe are two that come to mind for being incredible at this. They took the cycle time back from build something, get feedback, fix it, down to incredibly short periods. And so, I think it's impossible to build a great product without doing this. But the kind of canonical great founding team is one person who wants to build product, one person who wants to go off and talk to users. And that combination works really well. It can happen in the same person, but I think the company needs both of those things going in a cycle.
Unknown: Can you talk about some of the teams that have done that, perhaps going into Airbnb and Stripe? And even Stripe, I mean, how many years was it before Stripe publicly launched and started growing? Well,
Sam Altman: Stripe had users very quickly but they were in private beta. And because the financial system was so regulated, they couldn't take on too many. So Stripe officially launched several times. They kept doing it to broader and broader groups and getting more and more press. But probably what they would count as their official launch was a year, a year and a half in. But they got users really quickly. One user and then three users. And what they would do, in fact, this became so popular that we named it at Y Combinator. We call it the Collison Install. The brother's last name is Collison. They would find a company they thought should use their product. And
Unknown: outsiders like Stripe and Dropbox and so on. But what were the companies that early on had the same characteristics but didn't execute in the right way? How did you see that play out?
Sam Altman: but pick the wrong market or someone else just does something a little bit differently and it works better than you. And you can be a team that was as smart and as hardworking as the one that won. And for factors So, we we try not to overcorrect for false positives. I think one thing that investors get really wrong is they see a pattern fail once and then they are like, you know what? I'm never investing in another home sharing company again. And that's really dangerous. So, we talk a lot about false negatives. Those are terrible. We talk a little bit about false positives. But I think it's very dangerous to talk a lot about false positives. Because the thing a thing that didn't work in the past can always work again in the future. And it's so And a person that's failed their first time can succeed wildly their second time. You know, this is not that well known. But many of our most successful founders were coming through Y Combinator for the second time on an idea that VCs as a whole had decided was dead. So, Drew Houston first applied to YC with a very bad idea. And applied with an idea, file sharing, that all VCs had decided was long over. And it would be very easy to not fund that company and that would have been really bad. Many of our other successful companies have a similar story.
Unknown: although Dropbox got retrofitted to the lean lean startup movement, but having seen it on the inside, they were basically right with their initial hypothesis, the product that the company wanted. And they continued executing on that and execute on it really, really well and built a great team around it. But they didn't actually fundamentally, in the first couple of years, pivot much at all. They just kept going. To what extent have you seen the really successful companies be a result of dramatic pivots versus actually keeping refining the original hypothesis?
Sam Altman: Dramatic pivots almost never work. There are exceptions, and the exceptions usually come when the pivot is what the founder wanted to build in the first place. I think that Snapchat is sorry, Instagram is the most common exception of this example of this, where they started off building this thing that was like a location based social network. It wasn't working. And then Kevin Systrom went on vacation and he was really bombing. He's like, I'm just gonna build something for fun. And he was still as a very passionate photographer. At the time, iPhone cameras weren't very good. So, And he's like, well, how could I make iPhone cameras more satisfying to use given this limitation? And, he came up with the idea of filters as a way of addressing the problem with low quality iPhone images and still making them sort of aesthetically pleasing. And, you know, then obviously you wanna share them. So, that was a pivot that worked, but it came out of the project that the founder always wanted to build. The kind of pivot where you say, damn it, our startup is not working. We have all these investors, we have all these employees, we have to pick something else and stand up at a whiteboard and just pick a made up idea. They must have worked sometimes, but those are really rare, None of our most successful companies have that history. The thing that does work, I think, really well are sort of successive approximation pivots. So Stripe started off wanting to be a bank and then realized that that actually wasn't the problem. People couldn't They could get a bank account, but they couldn't take payments. And that was really the thing. So that's like, if on the same vector of the mission, but you find out that there's a better way to do this thing that you wanted to do with the original idea, those pivots work all the time.
Unknown: off the concepts, because timing is everything for a start. Are there things that you see you've got so much exposure to startup patterns. Are there things that you see as obvious failure patterns in companies that inset themselves in thoseYC companies that don't tend to get talked about more broadly?
Sam Altman: A huge one is the team falls apart. I think during Y Combinator, during the three months of our program, the number one cause of failure is the team falls apart. And that happens a lot. And the reason that it usually happens is one person on the team kind of gives up hope. And and usually what happens is there's one person who's really determined and is gonna see this through no matter what, and the other person kinda got pulled into it, but is just, So And in one batch, there were like, let's say, 12 solo founders and nine of them added a co founder before YC started. And all nine of those, the team fell apart and the company failed within the first year. So one thing we've learned more generally, although that's a stark example, is that founding teams that haven't known each other for a long time and have a long history together don't usually work. And, in fact, to the degree we let ourselves pattern match at all, founding teams that haven't known each other is something that we're very, very nervous about. A more general indication of what I mentioned earlier, and I think probably the easiest way to trick us or our biggest systemic flaw, is we are bad at evaluating determination of founders. And we say this all the time, but it's really true that determination is the most important predictor of success for startup founders, more important than intelligence, market, product, anything else. And it's relatively easy to evaluate intelligence. Markets are harder. Products are really hard. But determination, I think, is the hardest of all. Talk to someone, especially someone who is younger and does not have a lot of evidence in their career of being determined they can point to and to try to evaluate that is really, really hard. That is probably our biggest cause of error still in our selection process. I I think another thing that goes wrong, and this sounds really obvious, is that people never figure out how to make a product users love. And sometimes, this is because there is no product in the space that anyone wants. But more often, it's that the founders I think one of the hardest problems any startup faces is of the million or the 100 things you could do this week, what is the most important number one thing to do? That's a hard question. And then, can you make yourself focus on nothing but that? That's a really hard question. And most startups just don't do either of those well. or very nearly nothing else. And a a lot of startups kind of get caught up in all of these other things that are urgent but less important, and they lose sight of the thing they really have to do. And those startups can look along the way like they're being very successful. They're getting great press. They're raising money. You know, they're off meeting customers. And then, it doesn't work at all.
Unknown: I've observed in spending time in San Francisco and London is that startups in London will tend to pursue larger customers earlier than startups in San Francisco because there's less funding than there is in San Francisco. when do you think, to what extent do you think that good start ups can kill their potential too early on by going with a large customer too early? And what's the right way to scale through customer size?
Sam Altman: SFO and I I feel better. And I was trying to articulate what about it I really like. And the thing that I think is magic about Silicon Valley for all of our many, many flaws is that there is a belief that you can just sort of feel in the entire area and all the peep most of the people you come in contact with that anything is possible. No idea is stupid. However improbable something sounds, it might be the next Google and so you better not ignore it even if the company only has two small customers you've never heard of. And, you know, we can build general AI and electric cars and spaceships and nuclear fusion reactors and Facebook and Google and anything else. And in an environment like that, people aren't that skeptical because they've been burned by it in the past and there's this wonderful optimism about the future and not being dismissive. And in most of the rest of the world, if you start a startup, for whatever reason, and I think it's different in different places, most people will, like, think about why you're gonna fail. And then when they talk about other people, they kind of talk to other people about your start up, they feel cooler if they say you suck more. And and In an environment like that, there is a huge premium on big customers because the constant sort of vacuum pressure's against you. And I think you should try to resist that as much as you can, even if it means it's harder to raise money, even if it means that you meet a lot of people who tell you you suck.
Unknown: a bit deeper into it because it is a really strong difference between Silicon Valley and the rest of the world, not London, but the rest of the world in general. That path and that belief that keep focusing on the simple things and the bigger things will follow. YC company is Weebly. They started small, raised a few $100,000 and then raised their next round at a valuation of $05,000,000,000 or so and just built great company and great product all the way up. Do you see that continuing to play out in the companies around you?
Sam Altman: where a company like the founders still own or the founders and employees together still own like 92% The You know, the good news about Silicon Valley is that capital's cheap. The bad news is that everything else is expensive. So it's like really hard to hire people. Office rents are crazy. And so some people have said, You know what? Although this capital sounds cheap, it's a bad deal because anything I spend it on is going to just be so expensive. So I'm going to raise only a small amount of money, not have a big team and get a lot done. WhatsApp is a very famous example of this.
Unknown: Something that's I I think there are the companies that have huge natural inherent growth, like I think WhatsApp did. Facebook had growth right from the get go. But then there's obviously a lot of middle ground companies that aren't obviously growing and aren't obviously locking down huge customers at the same time as well. That's the more challenging path to take because it's not necessarily obvious that if you're selling stuff at $10 a month, that there are going to be 1,000,000 customers to pay for it. What's the right what do you see the right kind of strategy going through that and getting more customers and knocking those milestones out?
Sam Altman: But you see it with a lot of people starting startups. Microsoft, giant company, they never grew at like thousands of percent like most people want. They just doubled every year for thirty something, forty years. And that turned out to work really well. Reddit, which is a company I'm on the board of, just kinda doubled every year for a really long time. And so, I think if you are building something that is going to have defensible long term terminal value, which most things don't, if but you are building something in that direction where you're going to have a real monopoly or lock in of some sort,
Unknown: The the hard part of course is if you're not I mean, you're on that doubling trajectory, then it's great. But it's when you're on the flat line trajectory pre doubling. What are some of the companies that you've seen go through that have mean, I guess Airbnb to an extent, but perhaps some of the less visible ones people don't know that have flatlined for a long time and then found their their groove and picked up?
Sam Altman: I This is longer than any rational founder would accept eating Dollar Store cereal every day with maxed out credit cards, but they did it. And it took them a thousand days of flatlining before it really started to take off. And this part always gets edited out from the story. And one of the things that we were able to help them with at Y Combinator was how to get out of that flat line. But when you look back at their growth graph six years in, looks flat for the first two years. That's just how any exponential curve works. But most of them are even flatter than that. And this is why determination is so important. It is so hard to keep going through that. It's so easy and so tempting to give up when people are telling you you suck and you have no users and you have no revenue and nothing's working. And sometimes, the right answer is to give up. But what the companies have had in common is even if they were mostly flatlining, they had a few users who really loved them. Like, even though Airbnb didn't register on a graph, the the seven users they had, like, talked constantly about how much they loved Airbnb, how important it was to their lives. or or Instacart in particular. I remember that really well. Instacart is this sort of grocery delivery thing and the grocery store they started delivering from was right near my house. And so people in my neighborhood started using it. And including Jessica Livingston, one of the co founders of Y Combinator, like, I remember her saying something in particular, like, if you take this away from me, I will have a meltdown. I think the right indicator is not, are you growing like that? And and you have to be brutally honest with yourself here, but it's like, do your small number of users desperately love what you're doing? And if so, you can often, usually even, get through the flat line and figure out a way to make it grow. And if not,
Unknown: Have you seen I'm not intending to be perversely contrarian, but I think you can always learn from learn from the corners that you don't look at. What are the companies that you've seen have a small number of users that were passionate about them and still didn't make it through?
Sam Altman: This is always hard to remember because you you kind of question your own memory like, did the users really like it that much or not? I also don't like to point out specific companies that have failed and talk badly about those founders, so I will decline to answer that one on two counts. Okay. Fair enough.
Unknown: You put a tweet out, I don't know how recently it was, but I really liked it. You said that scaling before product market fit slows the company down. Scaling after product market fit speeds it up. I thought that was really interesting. Why do you do you want to just talk a little bit more about that?
Sam Altman: a company can be like a little jet ski or an aircraft carrier, depending on how many employees it has. And there's like things that jet skis are good at and there's things that aircraft carriers are good at. And if you're like If you haven't yet figured out the right product, then you would like to be a jet ski. Right? And the overhead that you put on the company is bad because you want a little boat that can turn fast and keep trying new things and zigzag around until it works. And aircraft carriers are terrible at that. So once you hire like, let's say 50 or a 100 people, you're not trying to like turn and the product is not working. Now you're trying to turn an aircraft carrier and then turn it again and again and again until you get to the thing that works. And just the organizational inertia usually makes that impossible. Like, there is a reason that companies that scale up almost never successfully pivot once they've scaled up. you would like to be like a jet ski. On the other hand, like, And so, there's some point where you're like, I am sure this is the direction we're going. We're gonna go really fast and we are optimizing for like might
Unknown: As you're going through that product market fit phase, there's a constant tension between the things that customers want that are, let's say, horse shaped car features and the direction that you want to take the product that can potentially lap those features. Have you seen people create the right trade off between those two demands, between answering the short term requirements and saying, hang fire,
Sam Altman: you're gonna see in the you're gonna see in the course of the future? One of the most difficult skills to learn as a founder is when to ignore data and when to not listen to your customers. And I don't think anyone is born with a good intuition on that, or at least I was not. But you develop it as you operate. And I think it just takes years of experience to know when to trust yourself and when you have an explanation that is likely to be true about why to ignore your customers. This comes up for me at Y Combinator all the time. I mostly try to do what founders tell us they want. And that skill, I think, is just one that gets built up via experience. And you'll be miscalibrated initially and you'll learn some painful lessons on both sides and you kind of successfully iterate. So just a case of trying it and getting a feel for what level of gut is right? Many people never get good at it. It's a really hard skill to learn but the way I got better at it at least was,
Unknown: not super often talked about contrast, huge contrast between what's an optimal strategy for an entrepreneur versus what's an optimal strategy for an investor. And so much gets written about the optimal strategies for investors. And Paul wrote that essay on Black Swan Farming that really summed it up in that you're wanting to optimize the small number of extremely high return companies. 80 companies in a lifetime, you have to optimize for the success in the short term as a founder. What have you seen being I mean, you you look at things through the eye of an investor, obviously. But what have you seen be the optimal strategy and the the optimal balance for the entrepreneur in in maximizing the probability of success?
Sam Altman: There are some people who they don't care how many times they fail but there's problems they're gonna work on and that's it. And if one of those works, it's gonna really work and if none of them work, they'll be okay because at least they worked on the things they wanna work on. And there are some founders who, if they're perfectly honest with themselves, you know, want financial security and they don't care about making a billion dollars, but they wanna be damn sure they make $10,000,000 at some point in their lives. And that that's the most important thing to them. And, you know, maybe if they do that, then they'll go take a risk on their second startup. And I don't think any of these things are wrong. I just think founders have very different primary motivations and thus, very different optimal strategies. And I think the question is, like, what you want and just being brutally honest with yourself. You don't have to tell anybody else. You should probably, like, tell your investors at some point. But you you can have the you you should answer this question for yourself and think about what you want and then pursue that strategy. And I've seen people at
Unknown: the extreme opposite ends of the spectrum and people somewhere in the middle. And I think people are just honestly quite different on this topic. Have you seen investment structures that actually cater for the different ends of the spectrum? So much of the investment structure is catered towards the large outcome, large exit. Have you seen founders go in and say, listen, I do wanna make a $1,010,000,000 dollar exit and I plan to do that in the next eight years.
Sam Altman: And here's how you can make money even at a reasonable valuation through that. Yeah. Look, I think that doesn't work for the series a model, at least in The US. But many seed investors kind of specialize in that now and are happy with it. like if you're planning to do something like this, you know, maybe like dividends really matter or something. But it it really is just like setting the expectations appropriately of your investors up front and sort of a risk reward and timeframe for the company that matches up with what they're expecting and what you want.
Unknown: There is a definite degree to which, certainly around here, it's the gold thread of the emperor's new clothes at the moment. You say that you're weaving it in, makes the startup heart regardless of what's going on. To what extent do you think that machine learning and AI are had to be a part of it and you almost certainly had to embrace it into your company. And to what case to what extent is it is it use case specific in what you're seeing? You know, I I also have a similar reaction. Anytime someone tells me we're gonna be the machine learning for x startup,
Sam Altman: I sort of immediately think fraud. However, I think that it is the best idea to work on. But it's the the the companies that really truly have deeply understand machine learning and are applying it to a specific industry try to keep that relatively secret because they know how powerful it is. And so they don't usually lead with we're an AI company. They're like, oh, yeah. We're gonna optimize So I think the companies that talk about it the most, it's the most Emperor's New Clothes like. That said, I think it is the single best thesis right now in starting a company is take machine learning and apply it to any specific vertical you want.
Unknown: To what extent I mean, my first I started PhD in computer vision, I would feel pretty hesitant about getting stuck into machine learning. What do you see do you you see companies that don't currently have a history of it moving into it and making the most of it effectively? Or is it getting And for people here who are running companies or funding companies that are going into machine learning and AI stuff, do you is there is there an extent to which they're now developing a set of technicians of AI who will apply it and machine learning will apply the TensorFlow and the other pre built technologies that are out there versus investing in actual core Do we have a roaming mic?
Sam Altman: So I think the best possible way to do that is an external adviser you really trust who has a lot of data in their heads about startups saying, here's our goal three months out or this month. Here's the current state of the startup. What what could we do that would have the biggest effect towards our longer term goal? And that, honestly, is mostly what Y Combinator does. So trying to find someone who who can give you an external read with a lot of data, Again, one of the reasons external people are bad is that company good, is that so often companies are bad at setting the right setting But then say, like, what is most likely to make us miss that? And, you know, you can try these things like do it every Monday morning, but in practice, The common mistake people make is they don't give near enough equity to employees. And I think, like, most people are willing to be very generous giving equity to investors and very stingy with employees and it should be the opposite. So my very rough math is that a company the average company should give, like, 10% of the equity to the first 10 employees, which most companies do much less than that. Our best companies have certainly given more equity out. Beyond the first 10 employees, you just run into a problem with maths and you have to do it differently. But I think you should on the side of of more equity going to employees. In terms of senior team or not, you you people have like very different philosophies. It used to be in The US at least that the custom was that VPs and up got a ton of equity, engineers got almost no equity, and now that's flipped. Now you'll often see like a star engineer get more equity than the VP of operations or VP of sales or something like that. So I think a good framework for it that is people will still be unhappy about but is at least fair is to think about how much expected value that person will add in the next four years to the markup of the company. And even if someone more junior someone's more junior than somebody else, they should get more equity if they're likely to add more value. And I think that's like the fairest overall framework.
Unknown: So just following on from that, Sam, you've got some fairly non standard, certainly perhaps generally by the Valley, opinions on vesting structure and exercise period for options. Could you talk a little bit about what your thoughts are on that and why?
Sam Altman: The main thing I think is that people who work at your company and invest equity own that equity, whether or not they leave. And there are all these tricks of the law in The US where you can make it really hard for them to own that. But I think the right way to think of this is it's compensation for the work they did. And even if they leave, they should still get to keep it. I also think the vesting schedule is a little bit screwed up in that it incents people to stay a year and then go somewhere else and collect a bunch of different lottery tickets. And I think you really want to reward the employees who stay a long time heavily because that is that tends to be how the really the companies that really win big win. So those are, I guess, the main two things. weighted to the back of it. So maybe like five or 10% vested in the first year and a lot of it vested in years five and six. in The US, unlike most other countries, if you exercise an option, you have to pay for the option which you can usually afford, but you are then taxed on the spread of the option price and the current fair market value at a very high rate. We have this thing called alternative minimum tax that you usually can't afford. startups. And we have thought about opening offices elsewhere in the world. And we don't mean it as a filter of seriousness, but it has worked that way. Like, the the number of companies that we have wanted to fund but have been unable to because they didn't wanna move to The US for three months is low. I think, to a first approximation, every entrepreneur that I have seen optimize for taxes on anything, this usually comes in the in a conversation about government tax credits for engineers, has not been very good. So the way the best founders are trying to make their company several orders of magnitude bigger, not save 10% on taxes. So we will, very occasionally, if there's a good reason, let someone stay as a foreign corporation. But honestly, like most other investors won't. And most investors that will pay the highest prices and dilute you the less are in The US or invest the most. And so we used to let companies stay foreign And we were doing a disservice to them. So we'll still do it if it's really important for some particular reason and that comes up maybe three times a year. Something like financial service law or something. But I generally think that most startups in the world today, and this could change next year or the year after, but most startups in the world today should be US Delaware c corps, no matter where they are in the world. And there's a new service called Stripe Atlas that makes that really easy. are you happy you stayed a foreign company? Do you wish you had converted? And almost everybody, and certainly everybody good, wished they had converted. at least looking at the world today, we would still recommend people be US C corps. What are the top five You know, one thing that we have done that is really different from other startup accelerators is that we always do the right thing for the founder. Even if, like, the founders come before our relationships with other VCs, they come before our own returns. We have this long term greedy, short term, super generous mindset where, you know, like, effectively all of our returns come from the 10 plus billion dollar companies. So this thing that most accelerators or most investors do where they, like, fight for an incremental gain and a $20,000,000 outcome, we never ever do that. We just give the stock back in those cases to the founders most of the time. But we always, always do the right thing for the founder. This makes people feel incredible loyalty to YC. And fundamentally, what YC is is this community and this network effect. And so we have taken probably further than any investor I know this idea of you do the right thing for the founder even when it's not in your own interest and eventually that will work out. Very few other accelerators I have ever met do that. And they fact, like, you know, a few times We we we don't We haven't invested in too many companies that another accelerator has also invested in. But when we have and a situation like this comes up, they, like, can't wrap their head around it. It's like they assume that, like, someone's hacked our email. So, you know, extreme founder friendly is I think still one of the most misunderstood secrets about us. Another one is office space. So we don't provide shared office space and I think that's really important. I think startups need their own space, their own culture. You need to develop this feeling that it's sort of you, especially against the world, not you, one of, like, other many interchangeable startups. And most importantly, I think you need to be in a space you basically need to be in a safe space for bad ideas. And if you're by yourself and you're doing this thing that sounds bad, maybe no one like tells you it sounds bad for a while or no one makes you doubt your conviction. And in coworking spaces, that tends to happen. So some of the other accelerators I visited have taken this to heart. They took their once open co working space and they chopped it up into offices with separate doors, and they've had way better results since then. But that's I think that's a really big one. reagent in how quickly I can scale YC is how quickly I can find good partners. And it's really hard, and I don't think, But this is like, you know, in in in a very real sense, like an excel the the product of an accelerator is its partners or the advisers. And trying to find good, full time committed people to that is hard and really important. you've actually figured out the user growth problem. So you have great usage per user and good top line growth, and I think you want both of those together before you're like, alright, we're gonna now scale up the company itself as fast as we can. I actually don't think size is the most important metric. I think the two things that really matter, one is how desperately does this customer need your product? And the more desperate they are, the way better because the more they'll put up with the problems of working with a startup. And two is how closely will they work with you? You know, the important thing about your first customer is not the revenue, but it's the feedback loop. And big companies have all these procedures, which means they can't just like they can't like engage with you as tightly. So it's like, is there someone at this company that I can call three times a day and really talk to and iterate with? and I will preface this by saying anything that's really good, is to ask about things that that founder has done in his or her life that are the equivalent of running through brick walls. And depending on the life circumstances someone's born into, that can be there's a big scale, so you try to adjust it for the hand someone was dealt. If the company's been around longer, you can talk about the challenges the company's overcome. But this is a case where I believe generally, if you can properly adjust it for someone's life circumstances, that the past predicts the future. So I ask about questions like that.
