Unknown: and you come across as very competent, you know, more than competent, then
Unknown: are outselling or you're outbuilding the product or you're out fundraising.
Unknown: Yeah. I'd also add to that that starting a company is an emotional roller coaster, and it's really hard to do by yourself. It's always nice when there's someone else next to you that feels the same pain, right, that you can commiserate with because it takes that to kind of get through some pretty tough times. If you're in a room alone kind absorbing all the pain yourself, it can be overwhelming sometimes.
Unknown: Yeah. There's loads of things out there to help. And so as some background, I work on more of the financial and operational side with start ups, so I often get asked this question. There's so much out there that can help with that. So right from the very start, when you're incorporating your company, there's services like Clerky that can help you do that, that creates very standard paperwork that all the YC start ups use. So just do the basic, weird vesting schedules or they're trying to protect themselves from some unknown concentrate on everything else because as you start to grow,
Unknown: So, you know, I think again, just be aware of what they're doing, track what they're doing, but don't follow them, and don't assume that when they do something wrong that that's a bad idea. You know, there's a lot that goes into execution, and and sometimes, you know, a good idea is just badly executed. is shows that this is something people want. You should continue to do that. But you should always have this metric where or this, like, threshold.
Unknown: great, they're in. And that's not how it works. It's a balance of a number of different things and a number of different things that we're looking for. And so it's very difficult to say, you know, this is what makes a successful application in terms of concrete things. It's much more about can you concisely explain your idea? Can we get to the end of the application and we actually understand what the company is doing, which you'd be surprised at how many applications we don't.
Unknown: a lot of people who are thinking about applying is that the application is very simple. The questions are very simple. And it's actually a really good way to think about your business. It's a good framework.
Unknown: And that's not true. There is no too early and there is no too late. We can be helpful to companies at all different stages. And this also comes back to the should you polish your product a little bit more? and you're not successful first time around, then no problem. Apply again.
Unknown: it was as rewarding as it ended up being. Right? I I just kinda did it because it sounded like it was interesting, and I I was passionate about the idea. But looking back on having started several companies, it unbelievably rewarding because it's so hard,
Unknown: And then as my company started scaling up fast, I I didn't let go of that stuff fast enough. So I think there's a lot to learn in terms of scaling a company and when you should know, what you should be managing and what your priorities should be.
Sam Altman: I wish I had asked for more help. And when I started my first company, was 21 and I dropped out of college to do it. And I'd never actually had like a real job before. So I only had this sort of like dim understanding of how companies actually worked on the inside gleaned maybe from TV shows. all of a sudden, I was managing like 30 people and I had no idea how to do it and I felt very isolated and alone and I didn't know who to ask for help. I've learned since then that particularly in Silicon Valley, people aren't incredibly willing to help even if there isn't anything apparently in it for them. They'll just help you just because. And so I really wish I just asked like lots of people for help.
Unknown: I think my advice is that when you hear about people talking about start ups all the time, they're always killing it. They're always growing. They're always hiring people. And that's actually not reality. And so I think finding yourself some trusted people that you can go to and say, Things aren't going so well. I'm finding this a little bit tough. Or, Things
