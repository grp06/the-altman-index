Unknown: that since we're the last thing between you and happy hour, you'd all be much happier if we concluded the panel a little early. So I'll come back to the research in a few minutes, but some would argue that the growth in quantity has resulted in a reduction in quality and that the signal to noise ratio has gone down. How would you counter that or would you?
Sam Altman: would have been good. And so the bar is higher than it should be. It might mean we're you know, quality and valuation eventually roughly converge, but it takes five or ten or twenty years. And so it's very hard to measure quality on the short term. The lag is really bad. But you know, think the rough metric that we use because we like something numeric is just the total valuation of each batch And if you know valuations in the seed stage have gone up two x but exit valuations go up five x because we're able to make these companies better, disseminate more knowledge, build the community, that'll be really great for everybody. never officially raised a venture. But even then, like in those cases, the ones I can think of, the founders eventually sold some secondary to a venture firm. So there's like a VC on the cap table somehow. But no, like I one thing that I believe is that if you're trying to build a really big company, it is in your interest to raise capital. Use that to grow more quickly than you could otherwise and have a great advisor on your board. So we definitely advise our companies to raise capital, growth fund we raised last year, Startup School, which is our outreach and education thing. But you know, a surprising amount of my time is still advising startups. are phenomenally effective at getting things done and getting new things done. I think that there is a powerful way in which the Joint Stock Corporation was one of the most important inventions And for those,
Unknown: Aren't you a for profit corporation though also? Research Institute is a part of YC, which is a for profit corporation. They even said kind of, if our startups are successful and the AI lab is successful, then good things will happen. No. your attempt to shape social policy, particularly around universal basic income. So if you go back to the onset of the industrial age, people also thought there'd be nobody working anymore because machines and tractors and everything else would do all human work.
Sam Altman: I I think there will be new jobs but I think there's gonna be a rocky transition. And also, I believe that as the cost of a really great quality of life goes to zero or near zero, it's just the right thing socially to do, to to have a simple support net that's equal and fair and where we don't have to have all these other crazy debates that we have. If you're interested, please apply.
Unknown: You've been outspoken about the dangers of AI, you mentioned it bit earlier. Expand on that for a second and then drop into a conversation about it.
Sam Altman: difficult to have a confident prediction at all about what that's going to be like. And, I know a lot of people do. do we think everyone on earth should have some input and vote into how that works? And, yeah, I can see it being really dangerous and bad.
Unknown: It's like every technology curve, right? Nuclear weapons have proliferated and now AI will take some time to spin up and then proliferate. Is government part of that strategy? Because that's what's contained nuclear weapons, right? Is government has managed to somehow
Sam Altman: was not a technological secret, which I think is what most people would say was, but it was really just this luck of physics that it's really hard to enrich uranium. You know, it's a very complicated worldwide geopolitical game. There are other things besides this now and clearly now we have technologies. But we have a whole bunch of other systems now. We've had those decades to build super advanced detectors and imaging and, you know, we have like a very complicated geopolitical standoff of sorts. So that My point was that that happened slowly and that was good. And I expect AI to happen very quickly. So what's more dangerous, AI or nuclear weapons? And today, that it's basically exactly the opposite. You know, computers are better than humans at basically all perception tasks. It wasn't that long ago that Siri couldn't understand anyone. And now, Siri can understand people I can't understand. It wasn't that long ago that computer image recognition was a joke. Now, like, computers can write captions for images. It wasn't that long ago that a human doctor was better than a Too early for me to pick one that I'm most excited about, but to just pick a few. One is what I just mentioned, looking at medical images. Another one is like a sort of AI lawyer looking at case law and basically the entire body of legal text to, you know, do output. One of ours that got acquired, our biggest acquisition of this year so far was Cruise, self driving car company using deep learning. But the list would go on for quite a while. I think this is a very fruitful area and it's not theoretical you can start great companies here today. Why do you think and it's a good segue to another topic I want to talk about. Why does why was Cruise acquired at the
Unknown: stage it was acquired at a? And then b, talk for a second about why Silicon Valley becomes Detroit,
Sam Altman: There's a long history of companies, founders selling too early. But,
Unknown: And Silicon Valley should not try to become any static thing. But the best thing I could hope for for Silicon Valley is to always be on the front edge of wherever the most interesting new technology is being developed. You moved from St. Louis, right? And we just said that AI and Silicon Valley innovation is eating Detroit. And then you talked about medical and medical and pharma is in New Jersey and places like that and that becomes Silicon Valley.
Sam Altman: And you will see technology companies get started everywhere because technology will seep into everything. So my guess is
Unknown: The United States. Talk to us about the difference from an entrepreneurial perspective and from a network perspective of the entrepreneurs you meet from all those different places.
Sam Altman: they have become more alike than different. I think one of the cool things about this community that we're all in of technology and startups is that it it has very quickly become this global community. You know, we now fund more founders born outside The US than inside The US. I taught a class called How to Start a Startup that was viewed more outside The US than inside The US. And, I there was a time when I would have said, and this would have been many many many years ago, where, you know, Chinese entrepreneurs are different, Israeli entrepreneurs are different, The US entrepreneurs are different. But at this point, are less intense than Israeli or Chinese entrepreneurs. But that is good and bad. So I can't But it's hard to make it's much harder now to make generalizations than it used to be because we have kind of converged to this one startup culture.
Unknown: Y Combinator versus now like Cruise, feels like there's been a transition from leaner startups or lean startup of air grease book to something that is now called somewhere between full stack and fixed startups that are really reaching into the depths of hardware commodities. I'm an investor in WeWork, right, same thing, four walls and buildings. Take us through how you think the funding model changes for that and the model for innovation changes to that and the locus of innovation changes for that.
Sam Altman: You know, there are all of these like different terms like full stack, light stack, lean, thick. being as frugal and fast as possible? You don't see that change much, but the constraints are wildly different. Is the culture right? Is the start up picking a good initial problem for a real customer pain? And have they found some customers that desperately want what they're building? adaptability, to something that eventually has real defensibility and significant earnings power is also important. How do you ferret out determination
Unknown: If you were, since this is a Israeli and California gathering, if you were going to impart one piece of advice to Israeli entrepreneurs at the YC stage first and then at a later stage what would it be?
Sam Altman: We do that today. We have a computer program. We call it Hound 9,000. And it reads every YC application in three seconds. And it gives us a predicted score. It's actually pretty good and very helpful to our workload.
