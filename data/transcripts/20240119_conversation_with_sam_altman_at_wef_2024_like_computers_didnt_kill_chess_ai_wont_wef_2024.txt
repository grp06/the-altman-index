Unknown: Where do you think realistically we are with artificial intelligence? What would bad people do with this technology? AI can be very friendly, very benign, very empathetic. Let me start with you, Sam.
Sam Altman: People lots of people have found ways to get value out of them and also to understand their limitations. So,
Unknown: You know, how the neural network operates, what weights it assigns to various things. Do you think that we will get there or is it getting so inherently complicated that we are at some level just going to have to trust the black box?
Sam Altman: why he's thinking what he's thinking. You're not a black box to me. But what I can ask you to do is explain to me your reasoning.
Unknown: a human being, can out calculate a human being. A lot of people then say, well, that will you know, that means what we will be left with, our core innate humanness will be our emotional intelligence, our empathy, our ability to care for others. But do you think AI could do that better than us as well? And if so, what what's the core competence of human beings?
Sam Altman: you know, like what same thing for like many other products that that humans know what other humans want very well. Humans are also very interested in other people. I think humans are gonna we're gonna have better tools. We've had better tools before but we're still like very focused on each other and I think we will do things with better tools and I admit, it does feel different this time. I'm certainly not a great AI researcher. My my my role is to, like, you know, figure out what we're gonna do, think about that, and then like work with other people to coordinate and make it happen. And
Unknown: what would bad people do with this technology? But there are many people who fear this much larger issue of the technology
Sam Altman: build these systems that deliver tremendous value while meeting the sort of safety requirements. Stay with the times of India for news breaks, analysis, interviews, and events.
