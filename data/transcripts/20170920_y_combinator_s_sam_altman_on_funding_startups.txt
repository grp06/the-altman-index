Unknown: So, I imagine you are all for, what the, Venture Capital Association is doing here, to fight against Trump on this. Do you believe that this is going to be rolled back permanently? Right. But you, you joined with the Venture Capital Group. Have you have you had discussions with them? Have they recruited you to talk about, Okay. Tell us, you know, we've had there's been many tech entrepreneurs, including, Reed Hoffman and others who've, been funding startups, to try to fight against some of the policies coming out from Washington. What are you doing, Sam? I know you've detailed many many initiatives yourself, and fighting poverty is a is a is a true passion of yours. But what have you been doing in terms of where you're putting your money right now and and how you wanna make change with with where you're putting your funds?
Sam Altman: Well, I think by far the best thing I can do is try to help startups with funding or advice or networks or anything else that kind of create the the a better world for everybody. I think many of the startups that we funded try to do that. I think startups are a great way to create new technology, economic growth, sort of just a better world. And we we really wanna fund a lot of that, and I think that's more important than ever. And we need to do that in areas that we may have traditionally relied on the government for. The other thing I'm doing is a sort of passion project is trying to fund help find and fund new candidates. I think we need to have a lot more voices in in the governing system, and we need to have a a very wide net in terms of who we have in our participatory democracy represent us. So those are really the two things I'm trying to do. Okay. You know, fund more companies that I think oh, go ahead. Well, I let let's take that second part first, Sam. When you say fund,
Unknown: you know, fund people in politics who, you know, who share the same passion as you and and the same motives as well. Who are you talking about, Sam?
Sam Altman: for startups, is identify talent you know, it's a little bit reaching, but one thing that I'd say that I think is really good about the current political climate is that it has gotten a lot of people to be active and involved and participate and be aware and and, you know, pay attention. And I think we we as a participatory democracy depend on that happening or republic depend on happening. And so I am I am happy to see the increased level of engagement. Although, I wish we had gotten here another way. and I'm, you know, spending more and more of my time working on that. I think we are already seeing AI transform our world in incredibly powerful ways. And the rate of improvement, you know, the the speed at which we are developing new capabilities is a very steep exponential curve, and you see it in hardware, in algorithms, and in people entering the field. And so I think, you know, we are still in the very early innings of something that is getting more powerful month by month by month. And one thing I've learned is that, my time estimates of when certain AI milestones are going to happen, it's something to think of the downsides or something to think about really seriously, and we should do everything we can to make sure we get the good future and not the bad one. Right. And I and I think, Sam, the the what what I'm hearing from you is, you know, projects like, and initiatives like basic income might,
Unknown: even need to be put, further or or even higher up in the priority list, as AI, you know, develops more quickly than you even you imagine. So tell me how your basic income project in Oakland, California. How is that doing? you you you find you find that actually basic income doesn't work? What if it becomes a demotivator for people? Then what are the alternatives?
Sam Altman: But I I certainly would never say that I have a really high conviction this is going to work. thinking more about all of the different possible
