Unknown: who is a good friend and has been involved in many scaling things. Let's start with your entrepreneurial.
Sam Altman: And I started college, after worked my summer after my freshman year in the Stanford CS department as a researcher, I loved that. And out of that, a project which eventually developed into LOOPED, but it started as just a project it would not have been a startup if it weren't for Y Combinator. So it kinda had got to the point and it was really fun. I'm very ashamed to say that I had been planning to go be an intern at Goldman Sachs that summer. I accepted a a job offer. And I realized that was much more fun. We're all there are three of us working on this project. And we all kinda knew who Paul Graham was. We had followed him online, and he posted this thing saying like, hey. Not excited about your summer job? Like, come hack on your project and you can make a start up. And, you know, that seemed like it would be more fun than being an investment banker. So we applied to YC and flew out and interviewed and got funded. We were actually the first company ever funded by Y. C. And that was how then it just kept going.
Unknown: I mean this is the very beginning. Is there anything from now having done LOOPED and a bunch of things we're gonna get into that if you could call that younger self of yours going into YC
Sam Altman: one general thing that I didn't understand then and learned pretty quickly but would have saved me quite a bit of heartache, is about how to calibrate risk. I think most people worry way too much about risk. You know, when you're young and you have nothing to lose is absolutely the time to take risk. And it's the time, unfortunately, that most people have most risk averse in their lives. They need to save they just they wanna work for a few years, build up savings, then they're gonna do a start up, they wanna do what their want, whatever. And I ended up in the right place, but it could have gone either way. And I was very totally stupidly nervous about the risk. And so this idea that most things are not nearly as risky as they seem, is a powerful one, and one that I always try to tell It's actually much harder to wait and, you need to understand that. Again, everyone learns this lesson quickly, but it would have saved some 19 year old starting companies often get wrong is because they evolve fairly organically from projects, you never take the time to realize, do I really believe that this is going to be a market that will support a giant company. And I think there is a checkpoint
Unknown: And how do you think about how do you think that they should make those checkpoints? Because, you know, from other conversations, know that both you and I think this whole total addressable market TAM thing is frequently very illusory.
Sam Altman: Yeah. Yeah. I think, you know, the most interesting companies start with a TAM of nearly zero. And it's like for TAM is total addressable market. The thing that I have seen be most predictable for a large TAM down the road is how much the people that are using it today use it and love it. So one of the things that was obvious when people got iPhones, even though, like, you know, there were only a few million of the first iPhones that sold them, there's people that had them use them every day and loved them, and it became, like, their most precious item. I remember shortly after the iPhone came out, I was in a developing world country. Was really quite poor, and people had nothing except they all had a smartphone. And and people, once they had one, like, 2007, but it was guaranteed that it was gonna grow very quickly because of how much people loved it. The Internet in the early days was the same thing. And I think a lot of other trends, It still feels like we're at the the PalmPilot, not the iPhone era. when it was a ridiculous thing to have a PalmPilot seven. It was the Internet connected one. And,
Unknown: use case for PayPal was splitting the dinner check on PalmPilots.
Sam Altman: I do know that. And apparently, like, So Looped I ran Looped for seven years. We got acquired and I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do next. And I decided I was going to partly take a, like, a sort of mid career sabbatical, race cars, fly airplanes, travel the world, all that kind of stuff. But then I didn't want to totally disengage from Morgan and that I would try to invest for a while. So I took the money I made from LOOPT and I also raised some outside capital and I became a very traditional seed investor. I had invested a little bit during LOOPT, but very small checks. Well, that was possible back in the day because the the the valuations were so much lower in the company. They raised so much less money. I I remember, like, in 2000 and I guess it was 2010, But because it was a different world, I had invested a little bit during LOOPT. I think I made three investments. And I thought I liked it. So I was like, well, I'm gonna do this as my sabbatical job. And I did that from 2012 to 2013. And I turned out to be fairly good at it, but I didn't like it at all. And running a company. I did not like being on the sidelines. And it just I didn't find I wanna do. And and YC seemed like such a promising and underutilized thing and so important to what I cared about. Or or at least I realized that there was this set of, like, four or five things that I really deeply cared about, and YC had the best platform of anything I was looking at, or maybe anything in Silicon Valley, to go address all of those. And that even if there were things about it that I wasn't excited about, I could get other people to do those, or I could change YC in big ways. And that worked out basically as I expected, which was great. apply the same thing that made YC work so well for software companies to companies in a lot of the areas that I cared about. And, you know, AI, synthetic biology, energy, where you take a company in a different direction or scale it is that it it is always funny to sort of, like, read the articles from the same journalists that when you say you're gonna do this thing, say, like, Sam is crazy, completely unqualified, this is not gonna work, YC is gonna die, like, going after hard tech enemies is so stupid, to, like, a year, fourteen months later, you know, this is great. Like, Sam is a genius. It was, like, predestined he was gonna take over YC. You know, it's ridiculous that YC is doing any software companies at all. It's all that sort stuff. So I think you just have to ignore all of that and just say, like, I have a high level conviction. We're gonna try this thing. And most people will tell you it's not gonna work if it's something new. Most people are afraid of things that are new. And you just do it, and as long as it's not again, risk is miscalibrated. It's probably not that risky, probably won't kill the company, and probably undervalued if everyone else says it's stupid. So we were able to do that. And the first thing was expand YC into all these different directions. I think the greatest companies are created on kind of the bleeding edge of what people are working on. And by 2014, there were already a lot of people making mobile apps. There will still be great mobile app companies, I'm sure, but So that was one area where we expanded. Another was just more companies. We significantly upped the number of companies we fund every year. We expand the geographies that we play a lot. We now fund companies from all over the world, which is a logistical nightmare, but I think really good for the kind of companies we can serve. Not a lot of investors are doing that. So to support those companies, we needed this large pool of capital. We wanted to, on the other side, really increase the top of our funnel. And so we started teaching MOOCs, basically, and say, hey, we're gonna try to distill how to start a startup onto a class and make that available around the world. But but basically, fundamentally, YC is sort of this new university. We are a collection of smart people that have some sort of shared vision of the world we'd like to build and the tools that we think work to get there. And
Unknown: efforts to scale YC, like this global geography, there's early and late stage, there's research, that you also are taking non profits through YC as When well as part of you think about and you say, Okay, I saw this potential to have a massive scale impact, then I went in. Which were the things that you kind of wish you had doubled down on earlier and which are the things that you would have changed in that scaling
Sam Altman: I think one thing that is really the two things that are really important to get right when you're going to try to scale an organization a lot. One is a very clear vision and culture, I think we were good on the vision and culture. You know, this idea that YC wants to produce the most innovation in the world and then do that in such a way where we make the future great for everyone, not for seven people. And and we've stayed we kind of talked when I took over about that, the sort of the mission, the vision, the culture to support that. And I think we've done a very good job of staying true to that. And and, like, one thing I'm particularly proud of the organization on is without me having to legislate it, If there's a company we look at where we think we'd make a lot of money, but it'd be we think it might be bad for the world, we won't touch it, which most other investment firms unfortunately have a hard time with. But, you know, we do things that other investment firms would not, like fund basic income research or support OpenAI or fund nonprofits. And so I think we got that right early. And that and getting that right is really critical because if everyone believes the same thing, You just need some. And I think we could have put a better structure in place earlier. We've gone through a few iterations. I think we now have one that's good, but initially tried to sort of just have no structure at all. you know, the the growth in the number of people of an organization sneaks up on you, and you can completely get away without any structure until you can't. And it's a pretty quick flip. super light on capital, and I think that is to our credit. So there are all these things that would have been smoother and better if we had applied more capital to, but the trade off is it would have hurt our culture and that reflects on companies. Like, I kinda like that when entrepreneurs come to YC, they drive to like, honestly, a kind of shitty industrial part of Mountain View. And so in all of these, like, in all these specific instances, we could have applied more money to problems and it would have helped. But I think there is something culturally important to us about frugality because we want that reflected in our startups. And our startups have the kind of bond with us where they reflect what we do. So, I think on the whole, it is good we did not try to go solve a bunch of problems by
Unknown: mega amounts of capital. So let's go to the YC selection process because we're gonna go into what are the lessons from YC companies. And one of the things I learned from The New Yorker profile, which I had no idea because I've never seen it, is that you occasionally bring a sword
Sam Altman: Concord engines and just like things I think are important engineering milestones. So I I I had bought this Browns Age sword, and I was in office hours. And and it had just arrived and I'd been waiting for this thing. You know, like I it had like, flown over from Europe and it was in this big crate and it I got it out. It was stunning. Perfect. And, this particular one had, you know, like the knicks of where it hit people's helmets a couple thousand years ago. It's a little dark, but Or maybe bones. Right? Yeah. There are a few big ideas that actually a very small number of big ideas that make YC work. And one of them is that because most investors in Silicon Valley will only fund you with an intro, or they'll only talk to you with an intro. And it is, honestly, think, by and large, a fairly insular network. And one of the ideas with YC is if we can build a process that's not too painful, where we can look at everyone smart that wants funding from us, that we can unlock a huge amount of value, And there's a lot of really smart people that just because of the circumstance they were born into or the country or whatever, don't aren't plugged into the Silicon Valley network. And we are a bridge to that, and I think we get compensated for that. But that idea that you should have an open application and you don't shouldn't require an intro, is great. Now, doing it well in practice is hard because it is very tiring and very draining to talk to 40,000 people a year. So we have a lot of people, a lot of software. this is like a secret. I don't even mind telling you something. Other people will copy it well. We spent so much time and money building really great internal software that only like 50 people in the world use. And the MOOC, the class that we teach. That got incredible distribution worldwide, and then that brought people from these other countries. And what we find is that when we fund someone from another you know, there's like this there's this incredible One of the things we realized is there was more demand for that program than we were ever gonna fill. We were shocked. We thought we were gonna get like 200 applications for the first fellowship. We got like 7,000. I don't know. This is not gonna work as designed. So we have now evolved that and the class that we've taught together into this new thing that we're gonna try next year for the first time, which is halfway between a lecture series and a Y Combinator class,
Unknown: So now let's go to a couple of the kind of great, you know, just amazing YC companies. There's a number. I actually hadn't realized the background economics. Think you now you were more edgy in your angel investor than I was because I started pretty early with kind of the crazy like, how much are your savings? But I think you had a higher percentage of your savings that you were deploying. let's talk about a few of them and what are the key kind of lessons for how the scaling, like what we have learned in Wycometer and Silicon Valley about how to scale. Let's start with Stripe, where obviously the Collisons are
Sam Altman: I think the number one lesson that I have learned or that YC has learned about how to scale well is that the first thing you have to do is build a product that is so good, people spontaneously want to use it and tell their friends about it. And if you can do that, you still have to blitzscale, but it's the easy kind. It's you have too much demand. The hard kind of blitzscaling is where you try to start scaling up before the product is really great, and then most of your effort in scaling is to generate demand. So I think the number one most important insight about how to blitzscale is that the good kind of blitzscaling is when you are not having to generate demand as you go, but that you first got the product right. And in many of these cases, Stripe, Dropbox, Airbnb, they took a long time to get the product right, but they were obsessed with that. And then when they did, all their effort is, okay, we have so much demand that without much more effort, we know this is gonna keep growing 30% a month for years. That's a real problem. It's a high class problem, it's still a real problem. How do we build that? So that is the kind of scaling that works and that has generated Facebook, Google. I mean, a lot of it's think the kind of blitzscaling that we have seen go badly is we have a mediocre product. We have raised hundreds of millions of dollars, try to beat that idea out of people during YC. And thus most of the mistakes in Silicon Valley of that sort in the last decade, if not been ours.
Unknown: actually in fact one of the things I think I've learned about some scaling things is that you initially have to do things that don't scale in order to get into scaling. And so, actually, in fact, they spend a bunch of time kind of out in the desert not getting transactions.
Sam Altman: Yeah. Paul Graham wrote an essay out of that experience and This is almost universal among not perfectly, but almost universal among our best companies when people that have a company with no users, no product, and no revenue say they won't do something because, well, that's not gonna scale. the way that you build a really great product is to be very close to your customers. And the way that you do that is to do things that don't scale. And so, You know, Twitter is the example everyone uses. And they say, well, if the company had scaled better, it would have been a $200,000,000,000 company, not a $20,000,000,000 company or about a 10 or whatever it's worth now. others. It's more often where I think the founders were really good at building a product, but then not good at all at building a company. So it never even got far into the public conscious. But it's rare. It happens surprisingly rarely. The node Kohsla has this soundbite, that I have always loved, hiring really experienced people backfires and actually try not to be good at all. the thing that I think you need most to scale well and quickly is two or three senior team members that you trust especially if you're a first time CEO. So the recipe that I think has worked pretty well in Silicon Valley is a relatively inexperienced CEO, who identifies a small number of direct reports who are really great at scaling things up pretty quickly One of the things that we're thinking about doing at YC is programs that continue to teach our founders more well after they're out of YC. The model used to be that you would go through And people there's so many more companies and more deals per investor that, I think a lot of these things that used to get taught one on one by a board member now just don't get taught at all. And so I'm interested in terms of what we can do to teach that to to our alumni.
Unknown: One thing I think you said during a Stanford seminar is what a founder needs is something like idea times product times execution times team times luck. Yeah. where luck is a random number between zero and ten thousand. Is there anything in particular you think that people should keep in mind about
Sam Altman: and trying to pick a market that's gonna be really big and trying to hire a great team and trying to execute really well, like those are all the ways you minimize the effect of luck. That said, there's just like it's a chaotic universe.
Unknown: the way that I think about managing luck is like one of the things YC provides founders which is really good is a network and it's the use of the network both for seeking opportunity and also seeking risk assessment. Right? Like what do you think, you know, like one of the pieces of advice I give founders is to constantly go to smart people and say, what do you think what landmines might I run to? What risks might I have? Not just do you like my thing or not because I'm sitting with you, I'm probably gonna say, oh, are sure your thing's great? Unless I'm, you know, deliberately trying to help you by being edged. What do you think about those as key things for luck management?
Sam Altman: luck is a big factor, but I'm going to keep working. And eventually, you know, because it's a random variable, it's gonna swing my way. And bad. But if you're also like, well, it's all about luck. And, you know, I have no chance. The world is against me and I'm just gonna sit here and complain. That's not gonna work either. So I think the roughly correct mind set is luck is important,
Unknown: go ferocious. Right? So, for example, you get a deluge of email looking for meeting requests. How do you manage that?
Sam Altman: I still think I manage this well because I still feel more guilty than I should about not doing things. But I try to be pretty rigorous about not doing what I don't want to do. you know, because YC is a services organization, I've just accepted that I'm gonna be very interrupt driven and that most of my time is going to be dynamically responsive to our companies that need help. And I just accept that I other than that, I I just don't do stuff I don't wanna do. And I think this is an under utilized strategy I don't remember not being into coding, honestly. I mean, I like, I got a computer for my You can, like, put a lot of stuff. Like, I like to I'd still read paperback books. I like paperback books. I like to carry on around with me. I have, like, a iPhone seven plus, which is kinda like works really well in cargo pockets. I carry, like, computer chargers, cables. They're just, like, you know, efficient.
Unknown: And I have talked a bunch about what are the kind of theories of what makes Silicon Valley unique is this networks of talent and networks of practice in order to scale things quickly. And some of that is to actually build a product that actually goes fairly global pretty quickly.
Sam Altman: incredibly strongly that the magic of Silicon Valley is the dense network of people that have are all together. And if I disagree with anything, it would be how quickly that will spread outside of Silicon Valley. And I think it may happen relatively quickly. So there's still a question of how long and talent and people and capital and
Unknown: the theory, but it would at least suggest a relative weakening of Silicon Valley. So let me let's let's do one more version of this because I think it's useful. So the central theory is to say, actually, in fact, part of what Silicon Valley itself has is network effects, where it's network effects of the talent, network effects of knowledge sharing, network effects of company and business formation. And so therefore, creating another Silicon Valley or other Silicon Valleys is actually going be super difficult because you need to have that network effect density in order to make it happen. And your counter theory is actually in fact that the networks are actually being built in those places because the culture of entrepreneurship is spreading. Yes. And do you think that the question of scale talent and ability to kind of play the scale games is sufficiently spreading?
Sam Altman: LA is not Silicon Valley. It feels like one of the things I've always said that makes Silicon Valley work is that startups are the number one thing. In New York, it's finance, in DC and politics, in LA it's been media. And it's still definitely not startups, but it's interesting that startups, there's a number of startups in LA, In fact, I bet there's more LA has not been traditionally thought of as a hotspot for startups at all. At all. And yet somehow while everyone was talking about New York as the second Silicon Valley, I think there's more evidence of that in other cities. LA, Seattle. And I think that's kind of an interesting example of where it was close enough or it is close enough that people fly back and forth all the time. They move. You can get people to move from Silicon Valley down to LA. And at this point, I'd say you have that, whatever that is, that density of network and talent and capital and knowledge and everything else in LA. And that happened relatively quickly. I have been trying to evolve down to just a phone. I still carry, like, one credit card and, like, a driver's license sometimes, but very often, nothing but a phone. I'm pretty happy on any hike. I don't I don't think big in an office very well, although sometimes, like like, if I look at the biggest ideas in the last few years, Like and I think people get this wrong all the time. Like, what you actually want is a small I think it's a da Vinci observation, but what you actually want is like a small office with really good natural light and, you know, comfortable chairs, I finally got that. But I'm a big hiker and I like being out by myself or with friends, but way away from, like, any structures.
Unknown: I'm just beginning, because we moved headquarters at LinkedIn, to
Sam Altman: saw what I thought recently was the perfect office, which was a Japanese tea house basically with beautiful custom wood by itself in a forest. So glass, wood, you know, a couch, a table, that was it. do not think about work. But, you know, a few months later
Unknown: One object from your childhood that you could never throw away.
Sam Altman: Probably photographs, honestly. But I still have my original computer and Well, in our line of work, it's more like that, you know, most of the people, the job candidates are founders that we didn't fund. And I wish love all the Star Wars movies. I love The Dark Knight. I love American Beauty to pick something that is not a sci fi movie. there's a poem called Ozymandias by Shelley. And, the desert, is this wreckage of a statue, this giant statue of a king that has now fallen in its ruins. there are a lot of startup founders who, in the moment, feel like they are the most important thing ever in the world, their company is going to be incredible. These are usually founders that have accomplished nothing, and that have this feeling of, like, forever, you end up in ruins, but startups often do that pretty quickly and it's a pretty quick change of fortunes. And I think keeping that image of like someday any statement you make like that is someday going to be in a collapsed statue in a desert has good and bad about investing in startups is it is deeply humbling. People forget that every time you make an investment, you do it with a belief that that company is going to be successful or at least that you're paying for positive expected value. And so many investments that I have been so confident about have utterly failed, and I was so completely wrong. That doesn't actually bother me that much. The painful one is they ask me to put more money into a future round, and I say the price is too high and I'm not gonna do it.
Unknown: Because one of the key things is to let certain fires burn while you're solving others because startups are inherently dead at the beginning. Right. And what do you teach them about, you know, kind of how do you go, Okay,
Sam Altman: like to draw the matrix of urgent, non urgent, important, non important. And everyone gets urgent, important first and non urgent non important last, but people screw up the other two. have to let the urgent and non important things not happen or get someone else to do them. I think a lot of founders find someone on their team relatively early on that they rely on to just take care of that stuff and never think about it. And And they But they're fun and they superficially feel like important networking or something. So we try to talk to people about here the normal tricks founders fall for that are bad uses of time. Great.
