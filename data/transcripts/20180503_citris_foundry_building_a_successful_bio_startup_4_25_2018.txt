Unknown: founders who have created biotech companies coming out of the university. So the first person I wanna invite up is Professor Dave Schaefer. So Dave is a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering, bioengineering and neuroscience. So Dave, thank you so much for being here despite your three appointments. We appreciate it. He's also the co founder and CSO of four d Molecular Therapeutics, which is building a platform to design specific AAV technology for genetic therapies. So let's give Dave a round of applause. Next, I'd like to invite Doctor. Kelly Gardner. She is a graduate here of UC Berkeley from bioengineering. She got her PhD. She's also the co founder and CEO of Zephyrus Biosciences, which developed tools for doing single cell protein analysis which had never been done before. So thank you Kelly for being here. Let's give her a round of applause. Next is Doctor. Kwesi Apouri. So he is also a graduate of bioengineering here, got his PhD, and is one of the founders of Corelia Biosciences. So they've developed a new technology tool for doing new types of proteomics that give you data in minutes instead of hours or days like standard technologies. I like to say that he's actually also a graduate of Citrus Foundry which is the program that I work at so it's great to have you here at Hwasi. Thank you. Lastly we have Alex Mock. He's a graduate of the bioengineering program. He's also the co founder of Mentra Bio and its CEO. So they're developing an effective and safe method for doing exosome based therapeutics to contract, combat new diseases and they use deep data and lab automation to do that. So thank you so much for being here Alex.
Unknown: We applied to NSF SBIR grants as well as NIH SBIR grants. So that's really, you know, I think was our approach and we were pretty fortunate to get some grants. It still took a year of writing grants, I'd actually recommend to people to start that process a year before
Unknown: that allowed us to get our first our letter set up with the the the Office of Technology Licensing. So that gave us our first, like, exclusivity to be able to negotiate for our license our our patents. also through that program, which gave us space. We could host investors. We weren't just in a coffee shop. We had a Bayview with Golden Gate Bridge and it made us feel like a big company that had legitimacy. We were also part of the Bay Bio Accelerator Program, which the FAST program, which we were introduced through some of the the the network here. Also from Haas, we had several investors that we had met through different Haas entrepreneurship programs. So we we basically leveraged all all of the different resources at Berkeley. And then, of course, the research here. There's there's such incredible technical research and products and technology being developed
Unknown: So we're focused right now on making exosome therapeutics, and we know that the cost involved in developing that therapeutic is going to be very large. So there are different ways of de risking that, and ways are in terms of partnerships to understand if there are other folks in the ecosystem that you could develop in partnership. So we're in conversation with different biotech, different pharma to think about ways to de risk that. When you look at therapeutics, there's a range, there's a scale. It doesn't just go to approval. There's preclinical phase one, phase two, phase three. There's many years attributed to each of those stages. And you can build value along the way that gets you to the place of prohibiting you from going down a route. So looking always at the value along with the cost
Sam Altman: engineering to understanding finance is that I would always think about things in absolute cost in dollars, but investors think in terms of return relative to risk. No one is scared of huge numbers if the commensurate payoff or expected value payoff is also really high. This just broke my brain when I was a college student. fretting the absolute value of costs and it's totally not how the startup world works. People are not afraid of big numbers if the payoff is really big as well. The IP thing, bio academics turn founders say that surprises them the most often is that they actually find people don't steal ideas 99.99% of the time and
Unknown: But I would actually say, you know, I think one of the best things you can do is is see yourself in that role early and believe in yourself as someone who can be that CEO. Because the the skills that you actually need to be a CEO are the same. You need to be to be successful in anything. So you have to be, you know, scrappiness, the ability to just, like, walk through walls and, you know, ability to communicate, you know, and all the rest of it is tactics, and you can learn that through different advisers. So, so I actually think that, you know, that transition, if you see yourself early as a as someone who can be that person, then then it's it's sort of self limited is what I see
Unknown: involved early, you know, as you're making that transition, if you meet people who have had experience, if there's other alumni from your program who have found a company, just just try to reach out into your network as much as you pass possibly can because
Unknown: I think assessing founder relationships early on is incredibly important and I kind of think about it in terms of how good and accurate that assessment can be with how much pressure that relationship has been under. Because in a start up environment, you are under a lot of pressure if you're doing it right all the time and yeah. That's that's all I have to say about that. But founding founding relationships, incredibly important. I've been very blessed to be part of now two founding teams that have worked really well together, had early early struggles, early challenges. One one idea actually I got from Kelly was, you know, if you want to assess in a relationship with someone that you've never worked with, write an application to YC or submit a grant together or you know, go through that process together so that you can get something with a hard deadline that will put pressure on you to produce something.
Sam Altman: you do have to treat it as something to learn, although it's much easier than learning science or engineering. It's a faster study. You learn it experientially. You learn it on the job pretty quickly. Number two, huge mistake to try to bring in an experienced CEO.
Unknown: where you as CEO often are doing the thing that nobody really wants to do too. So for example, I was the safety officer, so I was writing manuals to be compliant with state state regulations, which is literally the most boring thing. I'm sorry if there's safety fanatics in the audience, but important important, but but not very interesting. So, I think that especially at very early stages, you end up doing sort of what needs to be done. And and if you sort of believe in the vision of your company, then it's fun. Right? Because you're like, I'm doing this. It's contributing. We're making progress. And that's the high you get.
Sam Altman: I think one thing that I look for is, Has this person accomplished the things that I want to accomplish? large funds that were not our own money. I asked a few people And then I think someone you have a personal connection with is really important because the best mentors are usually extremely busy people. I think we looked at it as either the company raises at least $10,000,000 or the founders make at least a million dollars each in their early exit.
Unknown: I I I actually think that, you know, the sooner you can do it, the the better. That's that's my personal perspective because your your way of approaching things will be very different once you go into having a company and you need to figure out who our our customers are going to be. You need to start validating the market, figuring out, you know, how you're gonna get some cash coming into the company. You may you may overlook a lot of those things if you just are strictly kind of under the umbrella of the academic role. So I actually think it's good. I mean, once you, you know, you have some validated technology where you feel like at least, you know, you published and you're confident that it works, I personally would would recommend, you know, doing that, you know, earlier rather than later because you'll start to validate the business aspect if this is a real business more than you would if you stayed in the academic environment.
Unknown: So we we were sort of as a especially as a female entrepreneur, I was kind of told early on, you know, bring in a gray haired guy. And and I think that, you know, there's a lot of pressure to do that, especially when you're sort of a young first time CEO coming out of an academic environment. So we brought in some some people that were very experienced, and and I think that that that gave us some benefits. But but I think in retrospect, it would have been good to sort of bring them in sort of at the appropriate time later on in the company and and sort of build the team sort of a little bit more organically. So I think it it was a fork in the road because it's it seemed like something that was required to start,
