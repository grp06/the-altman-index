Unknown: First of all, welcome all of you and to be honest, I'm really impressed because only thirty minutes after we announced that Sam Altman will come to visit us, everything was booked until to the last seat. So, Sam, welcome here at QM. It's an honor and a pleasure for us to have you here today. the scientific staff, professors, guests, partners from industry, I think everybody knows that both of you are not just the talk of the town. You are really the talk of the globe. And I think that makes you becoming one of the breakthrough pioneers in 2023. And your product, Jet GPT, I think, changed so many things. It changed the content of our discussions, in our human civilization. It will change how we run companies, it will change how we do new businesses, it will change probably the productivity of science, it may make do not come for our highest price. And this is the price of humanity. It's the price of self determination. And only I think if we bring both together technological advantage and technological advance and combine that with ethical standards, so that those technologies become indeed, so to say, a companion of humans, a supporter of us, a helper. Those systems at the very end augment our own capabilities and do not work as competitors. as usual, the Toom Speaker Series really managed Stefi Ciani is the Managing Director of the DLD and she will give the welcome words to you as well. So Joy.
Unknown: Thank you, president Hoffman. You're an amazing president of an amazing university with great students and a bright faculty. So, It's my great, great pleasure to welcome you all here with our very special guest, dear Sam Altman and his friends. power of artificial intelligence. But as you can see, I'm not the youngest person here in the room, maybe the oldest one, and I just want to let you know that I've seen quite a few disruption of technologies in the last thirty years. I've experienced them all because I'm curious, and sometimes it's good to be to have a short recap now. Remember remember, my dears, some of you have been in kindergarten then or even not born. The birth of the commercial Internet in the early nineteen nineties, with the first Internet browsers like Mosaic, Mark Andreessen's Mosaic, Netscape. Who of you remembers Netscape? Good old Netscape, swallowed by the Internet Explorer. Or who of you remember this unexpected, very unexpected speedboat called Google, which made the knowledge of our world all of a sudden available, And there was the disruption of entire industries like retail, publishing, and music, and many more. And most recently, we got into so called frontier technologies like blockchain. Who is a blockchain guy? In all this, AI has been on a constant and steady rise. It has become better, and much more powerful. And now, it's very, very fundamental that we've seen seen over the last years what it's how it's very, important and fundamental, what we've seen in the last years with GPT Please, my dear friends here in this audience, in this amazing audience, realize this is only the beginning. Mister Hoffman, you already said it, but I have to repeat I have to repeat it because it's so important. The beginning of a transformative revolution. And you, my dear friends, sitting here looking at me, you're part of it, and you better be part of it. Everyone is asking now, what does generative AI mean for us? What does it mean for our future, for businesses, and for values, for our values? We really have to ask ourselves, are we holding the key to a prosperous and Pandora's box and unleashed something uncontrollable? Question mark. Question mark. The cat's cat is out of the bag, and that's for sure. And we won't be able to lure it back in. Who of you love cats? to actively shape the new reality we are facing. Now, in our days, digitalization is like electricity. We know it. But now, now it's a new world. So let's dive together into the unknown. Let's dare to know and make it our mission to understand and work with the complex world of generative AI. Prompt and train not only large language models. Prompt and train not only large language models, but more importantly for yourself, the left side train the left side of your own brain. Learn to ask intelligent questions. But don't forget to recognize the patterns of your personal intuition. Trust just trust yourself more than ever. Just trust yourself more than ever. Please believe me, it's true. So be optimistic and very courageous in making the AI transformation of our world happen. The glass is half full, not empty. Be deeply curious and clear eyed but clear eyed critical. Please, please, please take personal action. Personal action. You are the one who are the future. Sam, here you are. Here here you are with your wonderful team. Thanks for your team. Working with them was an amazing experience. in you are a role model in your humanistic in your humanistic drivenness in your humanistic drivenness to embrace our future. I'm so very curious to learn from you, and I'm proud to co host here this great event. It's great that you choose Munich as your stop in Germany for your world tour. Must be very exhausting. No, it isn't. Cool. Munich is the place to be when we talk about development of future AI driven technologies and the building of new business around them. Munich is the place to be. From the and the rest of the amazing Dome speaker series. And to Reinhard Heckel, professor Reinhard Heckel, who lured you to Munich, and to my new friend, Theresa Lopez. Theresa, and the honor because he became a friend meanwhile. Reiner Tekel, professor Reiner Tekel, the floor is now yours.
Sam Altman: What you really want here is what makes this special, why it's worth spending all this money and effort is that it's a reasoning engine and we're training it to be a reasoning engine. We're not training it to like memorize all current data, and then we'll figure out some sort of retrieval like approach that give it the ability to search the internet so that it can know who won the sports game tonight or what happened yesterday. I think that'll be a better approach. But we will try to figure out to train continuously because that's important for other reasons. great vibrant open source work happening. And, will will not be open sourced right away. And that'll give us time to figure out what we need to mitigate, what the safety issues are. But my sense is that lag time is probably something we are going to want more and more. We'll be happier and happier to have that over time. Okay. I think there's a ton of work that's happened in universities that wouldn't have happened at somewhere like OpenAI. I think the things that OpenAI is good at, sort of the culture we have, the way we work, wouldn't quite translate to a university department. has a good a good focus on. You know, it's not always a it's not usually about the one big breakthrough idea. Sometimes those happen. But it's about doing 200 little things all really well, and everybody looking at the entire, jointly optimizing across the entire stack. So the people that work on the, that like the networking for our big cluster are talking to the people doing the ML research and the people collecting the data sets. And that's really important. But we sweat every detail, everybody looks at trying to sort of optimize this one super hard thing we're doing. So hundreds of people work together and they're all just trying to like make the GPT-four model be good. And then the other thing is a culture that is good at repeating innovation. And I think this is one of the harder things to build in any kind of institution, business, the academy, whatever. But people who are people who are focused on figuring out how we're gonna do the next thing, and the next thing, and the next thing, even if it's different each time, and being a great majority of jobs to be better off if they embrace AI than not. Like, one thing I would say confidently is that the rate of change in the future is gonna be much faster and people who use AI tools are going to be more productive, more effective than people who don't. But beyond that, the ways it actually rolls out, you know, if you if you look at the historical predictions for a technology like this. I I generally think it is better to wait and see what's gonna happen and then regulate responsibly. but also all the people who are being impacted by this technology and asking what they'd like us to do, how they want this to work, what they want the limits to be, how we should decide what the values of these systems are going to be and how much how we make sure that people can customize it by country, by jurisdiction, by culture, by individual. But another part of this is to talk about the importance of regulation, and we think it's really important. I think that's good. I think that's fine at least. I think we do have to define what the outer bounds of a system are going to be. What You are the things that it just won't do? And then also if you're using it in Germany versus using it in The US, there will be different laws and some things that it can do in one place and not another. of what they're going to how they want the system to behave, what their value system is, is really important. We've done our first little thing with that, with the system message But I think we're gonna have to figure out in at least fifteen years and honestly probably longer than that to be starting a career in technology. Like this this two or three year period that's about to happen I think this this is gonna be the most useful, impactful, beneficial, amazing tool that humanity has yet created.
