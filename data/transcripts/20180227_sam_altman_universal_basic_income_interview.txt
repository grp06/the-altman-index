Sam Altman: either because there's no way that they should make money or because we just don't think they should be owned by a single company trying to maximize profits that is work we want to support that fits our mission but is a bad fit for a startup. We started just like making grants to individual researchers. it turns out you can do a lot of things at small scale with you know like a sort of private levels of capital and time that are the kinds of things governments used to do. That's one big advantage of technology. And so we thought we'd start you know we'd try that. Our plan was to do one project per year. We have gone a little faster than that. But I think there are this will get more important to us over time not less. I think there are these you know we are at an unusual moment in history in terms of how much things are going to shift in a relatively short period of time and trying to figure out ahead of time ahead of time is a good way of doing things. There is a lot of, I mean we collect as much data as we can. So you know we try to work on the big problems that sort of massively affect society and you can kind of make a list if you just sort of look at like healthcare obviously is huge, cost of living, cities, housing obviously huge, you know future of work AI. So you can you can look at the big ones but in terms of the order to do them and the ones that we pick versus don't pick that's really hard. We like to do things that where we feel like if we don't do them they won't happen and they're super important. So there are a lot of other hugely important projects in the world that we're not working on but other people who are really good are and we're happy about that. We're sort of you know we want to get as much leverage You can work on that as a startup really well. Capitalism is set up not perfectly. We had to redirect it a little bit. But we can fund a lot of clean energy companies and I believe one of them will work. And that's a really important thing to do. But that is a problem that is at a stage and a scale that I think works better for profit companies. But that's a huge one. I think one that we have not yet decided to work on as a YC research project but we may is something around basically bioterrorism. I'm sort of surprised given the magnitude of this problem. Again food and water hugely important problem. A lot of good people already working on that. I think we are seeing good things there. Education governance and coordinated behavior. So I think if Well again these are meant almost all of them are very long term projects. Know it's gonna take five years until we have data back on basic income and But that's going to take more than five years too. So the time scales are very long. You can measure intermediate progress and we do. I think that's really important. You need to have, I think people never measure enough. People never sort of set the standard on execution high enough. One of the things is if you're doing something really important to the world you can sort of justify, oh well, we're not doing as well as we could but it's really important. how much it matters to just execute quickly and have a lot of momentum. So startups have the market force this but it turns out to be the way things get done. You get things done gradually step by step and the next day you feel a little better and get a little more done. And if you're not doing anything at all like it's always easy to push it off another day and work on something else. So just the relentless focus and intensity of execution that startups have. I think researchers learning that has been really great. And then I think the thing that startups in our community have learned from the research work is the value of really big ideas. And that you know, yes you need to make progress every day but you do want to say like here's where we're trying to get to ten years from now if all this works and here's why it matters. You know honestly I think this is not my original insight but I think you either want to be a manager and manage people and manage projects but not be involved with all of them or be laser focused on one thing and not try to do both. So the answer is I know a little bit about everything that YC is doing I think this insight that you should either do one or the other Silicon Valley gets wrong is this mindset of first I'm gonna do this startup I don't really care about to make money and then do the thing I care about. And I can't say exactly why that doesn't work because it sounds to me and it sounded to me like a reasonable theory. But having observed it a lot, it's better off to just jump into the thing you want to do and figure out how to make it work even if it means you have less capital available and have to like do it more cheaply and scrounge it together somehow. But I have watched so many people tell me this is their life plan and then get distracted by, you know, becoming an investor and having these great management fees or you know you want to do one more startup or whatever it is. People then put off what they actually want to do. So if you want to have a big impact on the world, start now and don't let yourself make excuses about the sort thing you're going do first. but getting like I think if you, I think having original thought is like the hardest thing in life. And that's really important because the things that everyone else thinks a lot of people are working on so you just, you know, if you don't do that it's going happen anyway. You won't have a big impact. The thing that has surprised me is people that make a real effort to learn to think original thoughts are actually able to do so. This is never taught in school. It's not taught in the work that I've ever seen. And I think given that if you have the same thoughts as everybody else in the world you will make no impact that wouldn't have happened anyway unless you just execute perfectly. Trying to come up with things that otherwise wouldn't happen is actually really important and really underrated. used to say that after meeting like all these people that have done these things in the world, he observed that the two keys to getting hard things done or important things done were focus and personal connections. And people I think are just bad at both of those honestly most of the time. Most people are very transactional in their relationships. Every time I have like gone out of my way to help people for no reason I have always been surprised when years later it comes back and helps me do something really important. And in terms of focus like I think most people try to like get that wrong. So the question is why aren't companies like Facebook or Google doing more to make education better? I do have some thoughts. One is that we actually know a lot more about how to educate people really well. their full attention to one kid, that kid is going to learn a lot. One of the things that I think that is very controversial is that although we are going to have massive job elimination because of technology, we're actually all of these changes in the world interrelate. But you can see a world where there's, as Alan Kay always would say, there is a teacher for every learner. not worked. I do think it can go a lot further and we should pursue that. We are pursuing that. The most important one by far is, is it a good policy? So a lot of people talk about this as if it's the obvious solution. It may be. There are other things we could try. And, you know, I believe or I hope that if you supplement people with enough income that they can leave a bad boss or move or go retrain or just take a little bit of stress out of their lives, they will contribute more, they will produce more, they will be happier, they will be satisfied. They will still find things to do with their time and they will that need to be needed will somehow get satisfied. So I think that's what I'd like to find is that hey, we actually can do this thing that is a net increase on GDP or eliminates poverty and makes people happier, healthier, better citizens, reduces crime, everything else that I expect will happen. But if not then we shouldn't implement it and it is is good to test this before we have to make a hard decision. seven years and I have a 90% confidence interval it is within the next thirty. So not very long. who would say that like the first thing AI ever really did to the world was make Trump win the election. But I think without You know, like the the people that did the hacking were all using pretty sophisticated AI. I don't think humans, unaided humans would have done that. And I think the sort of Twitter and Facebook manipulation, although a very, very, very weak version of AI was still neural nets. So you know you could argue that like I think AI is already here in a big way. It has happened so gradually that we are like a frog in a pot of water not noticing it's boiling. But I think there's already But I do think like we are I think the algorithms are already much more in control of us than we realize.
Unknown: passive data collection that would sort of learn, We do. Are even you mentioned quality, quality adjusted life years. We're using quality compatible measures looking at health outcomes. I think, I mean, there's an extensive amount of qualitative data, but I think there's a couple things that we're interested in as we think about UBI as a policy. And so one of them is savings in social costs. People talk about how to pay for it, but if people are healthier, labor supply response, those kinds of things that can be used in structural models to figure out what this would look like if it was implemented statewide or nationwide. 2,000 of them will be in the control group and will receive $50 a month. And 1,000 will be in the treatment group and will receive $1,000 a month. Most of them for three years, a smaller group for five years. And this will have a stratified sample so that it's representative in terms of race and gender and even income level within the income range. Then we will have this statistically identical group to be able to compare the average treatment effects. So how does individuals who receive the basic income compare to those that don't? We'll also hopefully be powered, have the statistical power to detect some heterogeneous effects among are there certain portions of the population, certain characteristics that make it more likely that they're gonna do x, y, or z. We will, as I said, it'll go for five years. We're gonna be doing it in two regions. We're not sure yet exactly where those will be. There's been a lot more interest from states. People have been contacting us being like, hey, how do we get this done here? So we really wanna partner closely with local government and local nonprofit organizations and so we're currently going through that process.
Sam Altman: I think one thing that's important to say that we're not doing is we're not focused on the economic feasibility of this national policy. I think I personally believe this would be a good policy even in the current world, although I admit politically quite difficult. In a world where we need this desperately, in a world where the AI really does arrive, I think the thing that everyone forgets is that one of Yes, a lot of current jobs go away but the cost of living goes to almost zero. You know, you can imagine a world where will be surprisingly affordable. And so even though that is the main thing other
Unknown: these lines with the negative income tax, their main goal, what they care about is do people work less? And I think we are looking at a much more holistic evaluation of how this affects individuals, not just, you know, employment, but as I said, time use and financial health and and well-being and happiness and all those kinds of things.
Sam Altman: I mean I hope about the time we're finishing up the study, we will be starting a national conversation about the most radical reimagining of the social contract that the world has seen in And a very long as part of that we would like to say, hey, we thought this might happen. Here is a set of data. Let's, you know, as a republic decide what we're going to do will definitely be here in a short timeframe. like most of the breakthroughs in AI in the last few years have just been lots and lots of hardware. And we already have visibility into what's being built there and we will have unlike Moore's Law which has been slowing down, know, FLOPS as usable for deep learning we will have a 10x increase each year for the next at least four and probably five years. And so that alone even if we never figure out another algorithm, even if we never figure out anything else will still take this massive amount of work that is currently done by humans and have it be done by AI. I believe that
Unknown: along those lines. But I think really
Sam Altman: But then how we talk about it I think really matters. I think basic income is actually terrible branding for a bunch of reasons but it's what the field has settled on. I have tried a few other things. I have a feeling that the concept that people are actually going to get their heads around is some version of equity where we own sort of some joint share and we establish a floor but there is no ceiling people can get as rich as they want. And I have a feeling that that is going to be the new social contract we all agree on and that it's gonna be talked about with some equity like mental model but trying to figure that out would be a major contribution.
Unknown: model, partly because as a society, we've moved so far towards, like, everything is highly conditioned, and, you know, I I think it's gonna be interesting to see, you know, people how people respond to that. And, you know, I think in a very positive way, people actually know the best ways to allocate their time and and their resources. And so I'm anxious to see that. I think there definitely could be, you know, as a policy, some version of
Sam Altman: we trust you. You do what you want. We hope you will get back to the world at some point because this is all this value we create collectively for each other is appealing. important and worth testing no matter what happens with algorithms being in charge. So again, that's why we're not trying to study like the mechanics of how you give this out, how you afford it, whatever. But it's really just like what is the impact this has on people's lives? I myself have benefited twice from a basic income sort of. Once was when I was 19 or whatever and Y Combinator gave me money to work on a company in a way that was considered very crazy and you just don't do that because if you give these people money they're going to waste it. They don't have control. Some do but some people it turns out to do incredible things. And then the second thing and the most important thing I ever did in my career is after my company got acquired, I took sort of like a year sabbatical. For the first two months I was just like burned out and I did nothing but that was turned out to be important for part two which is then the next like ten months or nine months I spent eight hours a day reading textbooks and meeting interesting people. And at the time it was not clear how any and every AI paper that came out that was like the year it all started to work. And at the time I was doing this only to sort of indulge my curiosity. It was not clear that any of it was going come together. And then it turned out that all of that stuff guided the next five years of my career after that in really deeply important ways. And the cost of me doing that was not high at all. But if I had to have a job, couldn't just afford the living expenses. You know, it was whatever it cost me to live, which is relatively cheap, plus a few $100 of like textbooks and like, you know before Uber I guess or Uber was kind of around but like gas to drive myself around to see people. And that was such a transformative thing for me and I believe that if we no matter what the policy is, no matter how it's allocated, a lot of people having that experience will be hugely net positive to value created in the world. policies right now is that every kid needs to learn computer science because programming is going be one of the first things that AI does really well. You will be able to explain in clear language I want this thing built and we're gonna like figure out how to do that or we'd give you at least incredible tools. So no, gigster aside I just I expect a lot of that kind of work that right now you sort of pay a contractor to build a very simple thing for you. I think all of those jobs are gonna go away. There will be there will be hard programming jobs that still exist but that kind of work that is definitely like that is definitely gonna be done by AI really well. I don't know if Gigster does this or not. I think companies in general, one of the reasons I like for profit companies so much is that it does align incentives. And so if all the Gigster programmers have equity hopefully they all benefit as the company is worth you know huge amounts of money. I personally think like people have talked about this idea that companies should do basic income for the jobs that they eliminate. I think that's unrealistic for a bunch of reasons. I think the government should do that. Companies should just try to build the best products and deliver them as well as they can. But I understand why people think that companies should do the basic income themselves. And I think like, you know, very old school here but I think like the government should figure out how to tax companies and people and then provide the services.
Unknown: So if we included just everyone in the population, we really wouldn't, you know, because it's likely to have different effects across the income spectrum, across ages, but anywhere, you know, from zero income up to the area median, which is, you know, a pretty large number. And in Alameda County, for example, it's, like, 65,000 for a single individual. And then we have put ages 21 to 40, partly, you know, because we hope the the effects on kids and how that sort of economic stability could affect children at that early age is really important. I think also politically in terms of a policy and so we wanted to have a large enough group of kids hopefully during the study to be able to study those types of effects. That was the beginning part of the question. Don't remember. Oh, yes. So there's a number, you know, certainly there are cash transfer studies in developing countries that all have extremely positive findings. You know, people make investments. They actually tend to work more, you know, spending on alcohol, drugs, quote unquote sin goods, temptation goods goes down. Even in The US, if you look at expenditures using the earned income tax credit, which is sort of the largest cash that we give out now, often, I mean, there's problems with that in that, like, people end up having to go into debt by the end of the year. I mean, it's a lump sum, and so it's it's tricky, but they're they don't, you know, I think it's, less than 10% of people spend it on, you know, treats kind of things. I think that's how they classified it in the paper. But then, you know, they're even on Native American reservations where they have a casino dividend. They've seen drastic improvements in health, decreases in alcoholism and smoking. it's in process right now. It's a little bit different. We've been working with the Finns on it, and their original research design looked a lot more like ours, but then because the government's doing it, it kind of got cut down. So right now they focused on the chronically long term unemployed and they're replacing a number of other benefits with the cash payments. The context is very different. Also, the existing social safety net in Finland is very different than it is here. So you know we are they're using pretty much just administrative data but you know to what extent we can compare results we are working on it. You know, we can estimate some we can't we we can't predict the flex on prices or anything like that. And the Kenyan study and even if we did, like, an entire city, like, it's such an open economy. It's really difficult to you know, even if, you know, even if the entire state of California, like, there's still an open economy, people can move. So it's really difficult. It's gonna be difficult to sort of estimate those with any certainty, but the Kenyan study that GiveDirectly is doing is randomizing at the village level. Obviously the context is quite different, but they are doing some general equilibrium effects, so they will be able to begin to address that question. But if you look at Alaska, might expect prices to jump up when everyone gets this $2,000 check and they actually don't. we have a website that has sort of the research design. We're always interested in in feedback and we you can sign up. We're gonna be up we have a blog where we'll regularly post updates and as, you know, we start to get findings, that kind of stuff will be there. And yeah.
