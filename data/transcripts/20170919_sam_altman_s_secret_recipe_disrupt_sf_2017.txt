Sam Altman: many of the most talented entrepreneurs that I've met recently have been operating in China. It is logistically super complex, you know, I think startups really are a super effective vehicle to make important things happen in the world today and I think we are nowhere near the limit of how many we can help. and when you do that, you don't you don't find the problems until you experience them. Like like a good lesson from computer science that has really applied to YC is that you can always optimize things more than you think and the bottlenecks are always super hard to predict. So we'll fund a lot of people doing stuff that sounds really dumb, most of the time it will be, and some of the time it will sound like a bad idea and be jaw droppingly brilliant. And and really what you're looking for, you know, the very best startup ideas are the things that are at the intersection of the Venn diagram of sounds like a bad idea is in fact a good idea. You know, I think the like, we we'd rather make mistakes in that direction than make the errors where we we say no to this company that will cure cancer or develop nuclear fusion or whatever. So we will do a lot of foolish stuff, and that's okay because we'll do some jaw droppingly brilliant stuff. And and the payoffs are such, and this is was always the thing that was hard for me to wrap my head around, that so the model is such that you've just gotta be willing to make that error. And so, yes, there are people who say that, well, is Y Combinator getting too big? And I always like, I always stop and think, like, if everybody else is saying this thing that YC is, you know, way too big, and I think, you know, is any kind of company, including YC, is this something that gets better or worse as it gets bigger? And given our particular network effect, given how important our alumni community is to what we do, Yes. That is a concern and we have had to kind of change the the software we have, we've had to change the way we work. But but at this point, you know, the alumni network is is basically a self sustaining ecosystem and people really like that. So more people in the alumni network are more customers, And so, you know, we will continually have to evolve as we get bigger and bigger but, university alumni networks are far far bigger than we are today and still manage to work okay. Right. And we have this huge advantage of we are ourselves a software company. Mhmm. So we are able to write really good software that makes the whole network work. Okay. You know, like the question everyone wants to talk about is this real or is this a bubble? is there is something fundamentally real and people get too excited about it at a moment in time because otherwise smart people don't get tripped. Occasionally they do, like the tulip bubble, there was nothing underlying there, but, you know, Newton, very very smart guy, still fell for the South Seas bubble. And and again, there was something real. People just got ahead of it. The Internet bubble. There was something real. People just got ahead of it. And and that is what I feel about, you know, the current the ICOs. I think it's definitely a bubble right now, but there's something real underlying it, which is why smart people are so fascinated by this. So, you know, like, do I think a lot of ICOs that are happening right now are of the blockchain in general is more likely to be really important than not. However, I was still a kid. The only experience I have the only memory I have of it is I was trying to convince my mom to buy Yahoo stock in 1999 because I read about it and thought it was gonna keep going up. this is the first time where I felt like I've understood it. I've understood this driver where the thing that's happening is people are watching their friends get ridiculously rich and that's driving them making them like, Ah, I'm gonna do that too. So they're buying and then more people are buying and, you know, this bubble is a little bit different than others because there is no underlying asset of of Bitcoin. It really is just how big the collective delusion is that this is the thing we all care about. This is a bubble that can sort of, like, become it can by force of will, can perpetuate itself into actual existence. But, you know, this quote I I don't know I've heard it attributed to a bunch of people, there is no amount of warning or logic that can save someone who is determined to get rich quickly. I I feel like this is the first time I've viscerally understood that. So I think there's something real. I think, like, people have been overcome a little bit by I think one of the interesting things that has shown here though is how much white space there is between what people want and the current regulation. And so I think you see this especially in the desire of non accredited investors to be able to invest small amounts of money in startups, which is something I personally think should be allowed. But, you know, then there's this like, don't obviously don't think fraud should be allowed and I think we really do need need regulation. I'm interested though in like how companies like YC can use the blockchain to sort of We need regulation for that, we need clarity for that, but, you know, the promise of this is a really good thing. One of the trends that bothers me about Silicon Valley is more and more of the wealth creation that is happening here is not available to most people. And I think that's very bad in a society with already such wealth inequality. And if there's a way that new technology can make it practical and possible to there are a lot of really important things to do in the world and we get one life and we get, you know, some number of hours in a day. And I and I am interested in politics but I love my current job and I think there's such important things I can do here that have a, you know, positive impact on the world. So sure, if there were no opportunity cost, I'd be interested in trying it because I do think there's a lot of really good things one could do. Well, will tell about the kind of people rather than specifics. Okay. I am You can also provide specifics as well. I am really interest like, one of the things I've learned about the political process is it is basically all about how much other people think you can raise and it is controlled by a small number of donors and, you know, like these very powerful but I think horribly run large political entities. And I have met a lot of really promising, more junior office holders who I think would be great. They've got great ideas, they work super hard, they have really good values, but they just have no chance because they're not chosen by, you know, the existing system. And I think in the same way that Y Combinator found out there was a huge amount of value to unlock by finding unknown people Mhmm. That are really talented but don't have a network and giving them resources. think a lot of people are thinking about that. It's something they want to try. It's gonna be a small experiment for us next year, but if it works I think it's something we could really scale up. And I think, unfortunately, right now the the left is pretty disorganized, doesn't really have a great economic plan, you know, the way this government system was supposed to work was that people are not career politicians but have a career and then you do service to your country and you do it for some period of time and you, you know, you may go through a few different levels and then you may go back to a career, you may run again later. But I worry that we, instead of this kind of participatory democracy, we have this, what I think is, fairly broken kind of So, look, I think you all two general comments. I think you the most important thing when someone is giving you advice or a statement like that is trying to understand, like, their biases and where they come from and, like, why they will say something that is either not true or not really what they believe. And, you know, certainly it's possible to imagine why people who run maybe the most advanced AI company in the world would say, oh, you don't have to worry about it. Right. I don't think we need to panic about it. I do think we should be thoughtful about it. I think it I think already at the level of AI technology we have today, there is huge reward and huge risk. And, you know, you see examples of this all of the time. Know, there have been a number of examples just the most basic machine learning we've had about bias inherent in these systems, know, autonomous cars crashing. Think autonomous weapons are already something to be to be concerned about and this is moving really fast. If you if you study the history of technology, there are many examples of very smart people saying, you know, two years before something is invented that it's never going to happen. In fact, there are some examples where the people who invented themselves say that. One of the Wright brothers, I forget which one, two years before Kitty Hawk said, you know, that he thought that human flight was at least fifty years away, and then after that happened he realized he was never gonna make negative technology predictions again. And exponential curves are always hard. If you look if you stand on an exponential curve, you look backwards, it looks flat. You look forwards, it looks vertical. No matter where you're on the curve, that's what happens. we evolved not to be good at understanding exponential trends. And there are many exponentials here. We have exponentially increasing hardware. We have exponentially increasing algorithms. We have an exponentially number increasing number of brilliant people entering the field. So the thing that I think is weird about the whole conversation about is AGI gonna come and do we need to be worried about it, is almost no one is arguing that AGI is never going to happen. Is it five years or ten years or twenty years or thirty years away? And all of that, compared to, like, the long arc of human history, is an absolute blink of an eye. And so whether it's five years or thirty years or one hundred years, I believe it is going to happen. I believe it will be the most important development yet in the history of technology, probably the history of humanity. And I think a wide conversation about how we want that to work, how that's gonna change society, how we make sure that benefits all of us, we how make sure that happens safely. I'd rather be a little bit too early than a little bit too late on that conversation. And in my own work at OpenAI, I have generally found that the milestones have come faster than I expected.
