Unknown: Artificial intelligence is reshaping technology and society. And today, we're joined by Shimon Wukashic, director of the NASK AI Safety Research Center, to discuss the role of Polish researchers in AI and its connection to safety and cybersecurity. I think this is a big deal. One of the largest organizations in AI, OpenAI, Sam Altman praising here some of these top names. We're looking here at two Polish names, Jakub Pachotzky, Symondsidor. I wanna ask you a bit more because Altman went on to say here that these two individuals were very much responsible for solving impossible problems.
Unknown: What what is behind is really hard mathematics and hard mathematics problems to solve involving optimization, assignment of resources, making those algorithms energy efficient, and doable also in terms of financial financial resources. So, basically, what what the people behind has to have to do is really to to leverage
Unknown: of these fantastic individuals can we expect? How many more, are there of these kind of, people who could contribute to AI?
Unknown: Well, Poland year by year is performing fantastically at at mathematical computer science artificial intelligence Olympiads. So so in the sense of preparation, we are very good at this level of of of foundations. So we can really expect this to to continue, I guess, because we we really established some sort of, let's say, school of preparing for this kind of activities.
Unknown: That's the cofounder of the of Eleven Labs. So that's another one. But back to your main point here, more con contributions. Tell us a little bit about what NASC is doing, and could we talk about AI? That's a a large field. You're dealing a lot with safety and cybersecurity. So where where are those practical applications here for you, and where would there be space for more research and talent from Poland?
Unknown: in the recent years. So we have really a space to to bring AI into real life. So everybody right now has is is is able to use, for example, an app which is which is report which allows you to to to establish the the story behind the incident traffic incident. So, basically, what we hope is to use these AI tools for public good, for public services, and that,
Unknown: Mhmm. And I think also, as we've said, talent, I mean, this needs coordination. Poland can't do it alone. I think also this week, there's a high level meeting where head of the commission, meaning a lot of heads of business and technology. How much of a role can Brussels play in all this and trying to steer forward more innovation? The the point is there, how much of this is going to be a burden for businesses developing AI in Poland and across Europe, and how much is it going to help?
Unknown: Well, so so it's a I I guess it's a similar story to the green deal. Like so we want we we want our AI systems to be developed responsibly with all the safeguards and ethical concerns being addressed. At the same time, it it puts burden on the developers of AI algorithms. So so the the thing is to find the right balance. And and, obviously, we in the sense, listening to the voices of of, main players is obviously important,
