Unknown: Well, I'm, very excited to announce our next guest and, somebody that that you're all anticipating seeing tonight. And, Sam Altman has, just done an amazing job kind of taking over Y Combinator as president, with the retirement of PG. Previously, he founded Looped.
Sam Altman: then I think the most important thing is to have how startups and growth are incredibly interrelated, and the best startups have growth goals from very early days. The Airbnb guys used to draw a graph that they wanted to hit, a forward looking projected graph, and then they would put it up on the mirror in their bathroom and on their fridge door and everywhere, and every week they were just trying to grow 10%, and our best startups do this. And it's so important and it is this function that shapes the company, that is when I think where is that that point? I think when you get conviction behind what you're gonna do. But I I think when you're like, you know what? This may not work, but I really believe in this. I wanna try to make it happen. Is there some data So that I really agree with. You know, this idea that I'm going to deeply understand my users and iterate very quickly, I really agree with. When Reddit started it was this sort of That was it, I remember. And now it's this, like, incredibly important sort of, like, universal connectivity.
Unknown: it's important to allow something like that to happen. I I like this phrase you said, the hours matter. That's a that's a really great way to describe the earliest days of taking on a project or building a company. What how do you how do you prioritize? How do you look at that? What what is your what is your day even look like?
Sam Altman: the highest impact things I can do are. Generally, I've gotten just really good at not doing the things that don't matter. The best founders are just they execute so quickly.
Unknown: what where where is that at with this batch? What what have you done in terms of your distribution
Sam Altman: wide applicant pool. And so we've made huge efforts to get more companies applying internationally, Good news, I think that's worked pretty well. The applicant pool has tracked upwards and upwards. We made a lot of progress, especially with black founders in this last batch But I think just doing the outreach, you know, going around and visiting HBCUs or having a conference for women that are thinking about starting companies,
Unknown: that goes an incredibly long way. That's moved our numbers more than anything else that we've Great. If you in terms of your distribution, are you more bullish on the growth of your YC network and alumni? Or on you know, I think historically, Hacker News was this kind of incredible, and and and PG's essays were this incredible distribution channel for getting great people to kind of know who you were. But are you more bullish on the alumni network in the future? Are you more bullish as Hacker News, you know, as important as ever? It's one of these things where
Sam Altman: the way that we recruit the best people in the world is by reaching in multiple channels. So the alumni network is really important. Hacker News is really important. Putting great content online is really important. I taught a class with a bunch of guest lecturers last fall
Unknown: batch over batch in terms of applications. But these aren't companies that apply to other incubators. I mean, that that's it's
Sam Altman: and a network for startups, satirical dorm. You know? They kind of I hope part of it is also the advice of the partners. We don't have a bunch of mentors, we only have full time advisors. We only have people that spend all of their time getting better at helping startups, and we have this alumni network that is incredibly dedicated to helping other companies. We've also funded now many billion plus dollar companies. Yeah. And the last time I checked, is sort of evenly distributed around the world, you know, 5% of the best founders will naturally be born in The US, 95% will be born elsewhere. I do think there are things that The US does that are particularly good sort of culturally and encouraging sort of disruptive crazy innovation,
Unknown: I once heard that that you guys take more founders from the Waterloo kind of Toronto area than any other international place. Is that is that an accurate
Sam Altman: that And, like, why is that? I'm not totally sure. I think one thing that Silicon Valley has that is great is that although the people here very much want to get rich a lot, they're willing to wait a long time to do it. And unlike most other cities where there is the other jobs, you know, finance in New York or movies in LA or whatever, sort of have this focus on like short ish term cash comp. In Silicon Valley, people are willing to wait eight, ten years, whatever,
Unknown: funding a thousand companies,
Sam Altman: Know, look, we're very fortunate. We invest our own money. We don't have outside are not that great. I really don't want to have some random hedge fund or bank calling me saying, you missed your quarterly earnings by a penny. Like, this is the NYC.
Unknown: There's, at the end of each application, you or and and, you know, I think PG did this before, you know, and and Jessica talked about this last year when she was on stage. You sent out this blog post, know, kind of, hey, we're so sorry. We can only fund who we can fund, and we got these thousands of applications coming in. Do you guys you know, Bessemer has this kind of anti portfolio. Is there anybody on your list that you say, hey, you know, you kind of say kudos to those guys. We missed it, but, you know, they've done a great job. Is there anybody like that, like in the YC anti portfolio? We do track this obsessively. you know, product about raising capital and when to do that. What are what are some of your kind of best practices on on when to do that? What is the right point, and what what the kind of the the triggers are to get that machine going?
Sam Altman: if they don't raise a lot of money, they don't think of themselves as a real start up. Like, it used to be cool to do a lot with, like, a small amount of capital. When YC started, we ourselves used to invest, like, 12 to $20,000. But now people are like, I need a million dollars to build my product, and that's a real problem, I think. So I think it is still an incredible win for startups to be able to operate on small amounts of capital, Helping entrepreneurs. Honestly, the thing to the degree that we have been successful, and funding important companies, like making, you know, like, making stuff happen.
Unknown: what if that I mean, would what what do you do if that if that, I gets you across the bridge when comes to it? But is that something where you say, hey. Look. You've you've crossed our values.
Sam Altman: and if someone It's actually
Unknown: let's take a couple of questions. Can I just ask this? You've got a room full of a thousand people here, so please ask something not so specific to you, but something that would be helpful to the general group, and please try to ask it relatively quickly. We'd we'd appreciate it. Yes, sir. Right in the front. It's all you, buddy.
Sam Altman: No. We we, you know, we we we are the most successful when we fund things that other people don't yet think are gonna be a really big deal, but two years later become a big deal. And it's very hard to predict that, And the best thing that we've learned, and the thing that has saved me as an individual investor so many times, is just fund the smartest, most determined people you can find with the clearest vision, even if you don't understand yet why it's going to be a big deal. we try to fund things and we love it actually when other investors are like why is YC funding this crazy stuff? And then two years later begging us to fund more of it. Because at that point it's sort of like too late and we funded our companies. But yeah, we try to fund companies You know, it's partly just a personality thing. It partly can be learned. One of the things that makes me feel like we actually really help at YC is that we can often take someone in that is like a slow mover and kind of limp and make them a fast mover and really fearsome. So it is possible to teach someone to do this sometimes. There are some people that never do it and there's just a disposition issue, And I think the answer that I give most is work with a technical founder. Don't just pick someone random off the street that you don't know, but spend whatever time it takes working another job, develop a working relationship with someone to found a company with. I think not everyone has any desire to learn to code, that's fine, people shouldn't, but it's very hard from the data that we have to have a company with no technical founders. It's not impossible, but it's a significant headwind. And there are all these reasons we've talked about. You can believe them or not. It's certainly something that in our experience we've seen as true. engineers because it's hard to evaluate or they wanna work with a great technical founder. So, yeah, my advice for anyone, male or female, is to to find a technical cofounder. many senses, the government is the largest enterprise customer in the world. As any other enterprise customer goes, the bigger they get, the slower they move, and you have to find ways to not have that kill a startup, which is what usually happens. So figuring out ways to move quickly and start with smallish, of like bite sized projects that government agencies can act on quickly seems really important. I think, for companies is not pleasant. It's pretty harsh. It's pretty quick. Often founders are sort of not super happy with us afterwards. But here's the deal with YC. and so we see tens of thousands of startups per year. We have to spend 90% of our time advising founders, And so we've learned as much as we can what what makes a great company, and we try to make our best guess in ten minutes, and we try to learn sort of what what the characteristics of a founder are, you know, clarity of vision, clarity of explanation, determination, passion, you know, some evidence that they've done something great in the past or that they have on this company. I'm sure, and the thing that sucks the most is that I know, for certain, there are these great companies that we've rejected, that had we accepted, would have become great anyway. But
