Sam Altman: people that knew how to build products, and that the demo was more important than the business plan. they funded eight companies, one of which was my company, Lut. And there were all these other things that became obvious really quickly. The most important of which was this idea of a community. And that if you funded startups together and the startups were loosely affiliated but not legally bound to each other, that you would have this shared sense of community and peers and a support network which is one of the things that you miss most as a founder. And so pretty quickly after that, Y Combinator changed a little bit. It grew and it became at its heart a a community of people trying to build new things in the world, Which I think is what Y Combinator is today. Today we fund about 250 startups a year from all over the world. We fund them at different stages. We have a a late stage growth fund. We fund fundamental research which won't make its way into startup for years or decades to come. But we try and take a very long view on being an organization and a community of innovators. We you know, I think when I got into YC, one out of five startups that applied got in. I think 40 people applied for eight spots. So 20% acceptance rate. And I think now it's unfortunately about 1.5%. None of the companies in the batch that and you know, since then we've had 11,000,000,000 plus dollar companies. I think that is generally a myth spread by VCs that are unhappy about YC's power in the ecosystem or whatever. I don't think any of the founders that go through the program or would like to go through the program feel the quality has gone down. I think we've been able to I think the quality has gone up too much. I think we have failed operationally to scale as quickly as would have been good. And so the bar is higher than it should be. It might mean we're because the bar is so high, it might mean we're missing companies that could be great How do measure quality? know, quality and valuation eventually roughly converge, but it takes five or ten or twenty years. And so it's very hard to measure quality on the short term. The lag is really bad. But, you know, I think the rough metric that we use, because we like something numeric, is just the total valuation of each batch I think some VCs definitely felt like or feel like they'd like to go back to the good old days when VCs had a lot of power. However, I I think this is a be careful what you wish for thing. I understand that YC has been a force in the ecosystem that has shifted more leverage to founders. But I think this has been great for everyone including investors. And if, you know, valuations in the seed stage have gone up two x but exit valuations go up five x because we're able to make these companies better, disseminate more knowledge, build the community, that'll be really great for everybody. officially raised a venture. But even then, like in those cases, the ones I can think of, the founders eventually sold some secondary to a venture firm. So there's like a VC on the cap table somehow. But no, like I one thing that I believe is that if you're trying to build a really big company, it is in your interest to raise capital. and have a great advisor on your board. So we definitely advise our companies to raise capital No, I don't I think we have a generally quite symbiotic relationship. So I'm one of the partners. I advise startups. I spent today advising YC startups. go to a bunch of parties and network and you know, like go to I don't even know what these people do. And there is the way that I think we do it at YC. Paul Graham has this analogy that he always used which is we advise companies. And it is sort of a grind but it is a rewarding grind if that makes sense. And although any given day can be repetitive, the we have a number of things that we do. We have the core program that people know us for, the research lab, the Hacker News, the Continuity Fund which is a $700,000,000 growth fund we raised last year, Startup School which is our outreach and education thing. But you know a surprising amount of my time is still advising startups. are phenomenally effective at getting things done and getting new things done. I think that there is a powerful way in which the joint stock corporation was one of the most important inventions of the last several hundred years. No one ever talks about it because it's not a piece of technology you can look at. But it has been a model to align a lot of people and capital to do incredible things. And so, I'm super pro startups. I think startups are a great way to get things done in the world. There are some cases where it doesn't work. And for those, we still want to be able to have that be part of our community and so we have the research lab. Those could be things like superhuman AI, I don't believe should be owned by a single for profit company because I think that will be misaligned with the good of everyone in the world. So OpenAI which was the first project we ever funded is trying to build that. It's a non profit. we will see a reshaping of the economic landscape in the world. And we'll see massive job destruction and job creation and a very, what I think will be rocky transition period. So I think it'd be really good if we could experiment now with new economic models like a universal basic income where everybody in the world gets enough money to live on. is not doing more of this, I can't answer. Combinator, the two funds are for profit funds. We're trying to make money on those. many of them will go away and then people will figure out new things to do. And I don't feel like I could predict what they'll be any better than somebody on the other side of the industrial revolution could have predicted programming would be the important job. I I think there will be new jobs but I think there's gonna be a rocky transition. And also, I believe that as the cost of a really great quality of life goes to zero or near zero, it's just the right thing socially to do to to have a simple support net that's equal and fair and where we don't have to have all these other crazy debates that we have. why do you expect the politicians to adopt that because you still need them, right? Yeah, mean governments are. One of the things we put out something we didn't expect to get much attention. We put out basically a job ad saying this is research we'd like to fund. If you're interested, please apply. And it kind of just turned into this like it was like throwing a match into a a, you know, field of gasoline. We didn't expect it, it just became this explosion. And now paternalistic to kind of parts of society saying, hey, you're not going to make the transition so let's give you some money? No. What I think is paternalistic is governments telling people how to live their lives and how to spend money. I think that a basic income where the government says, here's what everybody gets, totally up to you how to spend it. If you want to work really hard to make a bunch of money, there's no ceiling, that's great. If you want to sit around and smoke pot and play video games all day, that's fine too. If you value Do really think that's fine? what people choose to do with their time on this earth is fine or not. I I'm I think there are dangers. I think AI could is very high vol. And, when when we develop something that is a billion times smarter than the smartest human, I think it's just really really difficult to have a confident prediction at all about what that's going to be like. And, I know a lot of people do. You know, a lot of people take very very strong positions on what that how that's gonna play out. I just don't feel Do we think everyone on earth should have some input and vote into how that works? And, yeah, I can see it being really dangerous and bad. you know, like in the case of nuclear weapons, it wasn't actually the secrets of the technology that contained it. It was that it enriching uranium took so much energy in the early days that only took the resources of nations and only very rich nations. In 1943, I think The US, like 22% of electricity in The US was being used to enrich uranium. AI is gonna be very different than that. The, you know, this is something that will be able possibly developed by a small number of team, a small team, less than a 100 people. They'll probably need a lot of compute power, but maybe not. was not a technological secret, which I think is what most people would say was, but it was really just this luck of physics that it's really hard to enrich uranium last year or whatever was the thing that keeps him up at night is a nuclear bomb going off in Manhattan. I was like, yeah, that's I think people should be more nervous about that than they are. You know, it's a very complicated worldwide geopolitical game. There are other things besides this now. And clearly now, we have technologies. It's very different than sixty years ago. Have technologies now to make it much easier to enrich uranium. But we have a whole bunch of other systems now. We've had those decades to build super advanced detectors and imaging. And, you know, we have like a very complicated geopolitical standoff of sorts. So that My point was that that happened slowly and that was good. And I expect AI to happen very quickly. So what's more dangerous, AI or nuclear weapons? Three years ago, humans were better than computers at effectively all perception tasks. And today, that it's basically exactly the opposite. You know, computers are better than humans at basically all perception tasks. It wasn't that long ago that Siri couldn't understand anyone. And now, Siri can understand people I can't understand. You know, crazy background noise, thick accents, no problem. It wasn't that long ago that computer image recognition was a joke. Now, like, computers can write captions for images. It wasn't that long ago that a human doctor was better than a AI doctor at looking at radiological images a 100% of the time. And now the AI radiologist far better than the human radiologist. So perception is only one class of problems, but it's a large class. And I think at Y Combinator, we have been incredibly excited to fund narrow vertical AI companies Too early for me to pick one that I'm most excited about, but to just pick a few. One is what I just mentioned, looking at medical images. Another one is like a sort of AI lawyer looking at case law and basically the entire body of legal text to, you know, do output. One of ours that got acquired, our biggest acquisition of this year so far was Cruise, self driving car company using deep learning. But the list would go on for quite a while. I think this is a very fruitful area and it's not theoretical you can start great companies here today. Why do you think, and this is good segue to another topic I want to talk about, why does why was Cruise acquired There's a long history of companies of founders selling too early. But, you know, I I hope Kyle will be the next CEO of GM years or a decade down the line. I think that would be great. But you're unhappy about the acquisition. I'm happy for Kyle. I never go against a founder. I I think it will turn out to be the suboptimal economic decision, but it may be the right decision for Kyle and Dan and their team personally. And we're always back a founder that wants to sell or not sell for that matter. I And Silicon Valley should not try to become any static thing. But the best thing I could hope for for Silicon Valley is to always be on the front edge of wherever ethos will spread around the world and the whole thing will just become much more diffuse. And you will see technology companies get started everywhere because technology will seep into everything. So my guess is it I think it is, well I hope, We view ourselves like a university. You know, you travel, many really substantial companies not in Silicon Valley and certainly not in The US. I someone mentioned, and I've been keeping you to look at the data, that this is the first year where there were more billion plus dollar companies created in China than in The US. Yeah. But even within The US, if you look at the recent very large companies, Have been surprised to the degree that over time they have become more alike than different. I think one of the cool things about this community that we're all in of technology and startups is that it it has very quickly become this global community. You know, we now fund more founders born outside The US than inside The US. I taught a class called How to Start a Startup that was viewed more outside The US than inside The US. And I there was a time when I would have said, and this would have been many many many years ago, where, know Chinese entrepreneurs are different, Israeli entrepreneurs are different, The US entrepreneurs are different. But at this point, and maybe even a little too much of this, we were talking about this recently how there's just less and less over time. The I think The US entrepreneurs are less intense than Israeli or Chinese entrepreneurs, I mean there I can't say that necessarily cuts one way or the other. But it's hard to make, it's much harder now to make generalizations than it used to be because we have kind of converged to this one startup culture. You know, there are all of these like different terms like full stack, light stack, lean, thick and I have never, I don't think I've ever like really truly internalized what that those mean. What I want is to invest early when the valuation is low in a start up that will go on to be worth tens of billions of dollars or hundreds. That would be great, it hasn't happened yet. And I think whatever way a particular startup gets there is okay. And this idea that there's only one strategy, I think, is just wrong. I think they're really different but they're all really valid. And I think it is wrong to dismiss Facebook as not being valuable because they started just with a PHP app on top of servers. But what I think is really important is is this the right strategy for this company? I think there are some invariants that make startups successful, being as frugal and fast as possible? You don't see that change much, but the constraints are wildly different. Is the culture right? Is the start up picking a good initial problem for a real customer pain? And have they found some customers that desperately want what they're building? But beyond this, I think many different strategies can work. And the mistake is to sort of subscribe to an ideology. The mistake is to say lean start ups are right or thick start ups are right or whatever. And the right way to do is for this That's a great question. The one that has surprised me the most, although now when I say it, it sounds so obvious, is determination is the biggest predictor of success. And, you know, ten years ago I would have said intelligence or product or something like that. But these startups take so long and things go so wrong and they're so dynamic and they evolve so much that determination, adaptability, intensity, effectiveness, These are really important. The product strategy is also really important. So, you know, there are a lot of founders that build a product and it's kinda cool. And you ask them like, how tell me any plausible story about how this can ever become a huge company. And they just look at you like you've asked them a question they've never thought about before. to something that eventually has real defensibility Paul I'm not sure, it's pure speculation. Paul tried to I had to move my interview And so he was like, just don't even come. You're freshman. You can apply later. And I just said, well, I'm gonna come. I'll see you tomorrow. And they are doing great. I don't I think they've had plenty of advice imparted. I I think I mean, I'd be shocked if Israel entrepreneurs are not a continually Again, this I I understand the desire to to have a specific We have a computer program. We call it Hound 9,000. And it reads every YC application in three seconds. And it gives us a predicted score. It's actually pretty good and very helpful to our workload.
