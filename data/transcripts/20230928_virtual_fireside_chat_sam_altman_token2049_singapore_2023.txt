Sam Altman: for the whole world, billions of people, with a physical device we call the Orb that you probably have seen somewhere here. It's kind of a mirror ball. once you verify it, you receive ownership in a digital currency called RollCoin. That hopefully will be the widest distributed digital currency in the world. And why we think this matters is we think that proof of personal internet is going to be a major topic, but also because that lays the groundwork for QBI. And those two things together, proof of personal and RollCoin, will hopefully scale the network really, really quickly to many people. Tokyo, and just tried to be available in as many markets as we possibly can. So that's part of why we're here today. And we will push much more in Singapore specifically also. Other than that, I mean, we're really all over the world. We are in Europe, Portugal, Spain, Germany, in India, in Africa. Sure. We had crazy, crazy surge in the weeks after launch. So we have been at 2,100,000 users, I think, before launch. We are now at 2.3. But the craziest thing for us was that there were like long, long lines of people waiting to sign up pretty much everywhere. And that was really hard to manage. So what we are trying to do right now a lot is just ramping back up and getting much more orbs out there, talking to a lot of policymakers and just scaling. So we are now at 40,000 centers a week, something like that. But we could do theoretically much, much more
Unknown: and good UX for users. And we also have had a quite number of hurdles with the regulators.
Sam Altman: has had a hard time, especially last year. So there's a lot of questions. There's lot of questions like why crypto? Why crypto here? How does it work. There's a lot of countries that I travel to that really just try to figure out the general regulation, kind of the general regulatory framework around crypto. I mean, all of us are aware of The United States, but similar happening around the world where you have a parliament and ministers debating how to regulate crypto as a whole. And so honestly, lot of what I do when I talk to people is just talking about that. Because they really are still figuring out the fundamentals and the general regulatory framework. And then to your other question about use cases of crypto and general user experiences, I think the major problem that we all face is that most of the products we build are not yet mainstream, or actually very few of them are.
Unknown: asking, hey, what is this thing? To how do I actually enable my information protected and my privacy protected when I'm scanning my orb? Right? These are all very difficult and kind of
Sam Altman: Yeah. It really depends on where you talk to users. you you you rarely can make the analogies to other crypto projects or or protocols. But here, of course, it's very different. Think crypto adoption here is very, very strong. And so when I pitch RollCoin, of course, I talk about all the things that will enable. But to your specific question about data is that your data is deleted. We don't have any data view. The protocol doesn't have any data view. But more importantly, whenever you start using World ID and everything connected to it, it is separated with Synology Proofs from your financial wallet and your actions. So this means that you actually stay completely anonymous. Which is, I think, a very, very powerful thing, given I do believe that we have to figure this out globally, some kind of verification mechanism on the internet. And I think World ID is a chance to do that in a really truly privacy preserving way that also works independent of governments can solving their problem. It's very different, really, in different markets. Yeah. So the so usually someone of our team would travel at university with an orb, start pitching RollCoin and then pick whoever seems very talented or entrepreneurial to actually take an orb and take it from there at university campus. and roll it out from there. But again, it's very local. It's very different. It's very different for African markets than it is for European markets or Asian markets. But generally, I think what is interesting and different about Roccon is that we really try to be everywhere all at once. So it's not focused on only LatAm or only Europe, but it we really try to be balanced globally. So that makes it really, really challenging, very hard because there's a lot of different cultures, a lot of different backgrounds.
Unknown: What have you seen and is needed for crypto to reach main adoption? What are you thinking there when it comes to the next stage for crypto? that you imagine WorldCoin or any other type of projects that you see can really push the industry forward?
Sam Altman: I think one of the major things that is now happening in crypto is actually stablecoin transfers. Honestly, I think that's, like, pretty much the only real, like, large scale example that we have right now as an industry. So I mean, it really is completely from scratch. So we had to build everything down to Lens, really, pretty much in the middle of COVID. And so we had this crazy situation where we were sitting in a small town in Erlangen in Germany, which is like a small town, with and the hardware team and build everything he had a completely new story, taking a prototype and manufacturing it at scale. all of these things.
Unknown: topic brought up by everyone who either understands WorldCoin or who don't understand WorldCoin because this is what they care about the most. Maybe let's talk about that at the beginning. How are users' data being protected? And when you're working with enterprise customers and partners, how is that managed there?
Sam Altman: And if that uniqueness check works, you as a user then can verify via your proof that you're included into that set. But what that means is that neither us nor the service you log into knows who you actually are. So essentially, you stay completely decoupled from your your actual uniqueness code. And and then, of course, no data stored.
Unknown: on projects like Friend Tech. So I think last question for Alex. What do you wish the public to know more about WorldCoin that have not yet been discussed much?
