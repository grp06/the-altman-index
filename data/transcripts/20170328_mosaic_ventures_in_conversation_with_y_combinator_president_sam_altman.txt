Sam Altman: More important than intelligence, vision, anything else. We want founders that are relentlessly determined to accomplish their vision. We want founders who have a big vision. I think it is easier to build a hard company than an easy company. If you're building the ten thousandth photo sharing application, And in Silicon Valley, they've learned their lesson and they're at least designed our admissions system as best we can to be unhackable that all of our returns effectively just going do the right thing for you, we wouldn't have gotten to invest in Cruise. And so I think most investors look at failure rates and also try to win even in the non successful cases. And our view is But I think Silicon Valley is very tolerant to failure. Failure is not a black mark. like a set of economic arguments and there's a set of career development arguments. The economic arguments are well documented online, but in general I don't think early employees ever get compensated with enough equity. to the rest of my career as an investor was that as the founder, you get to do every job. And as anybody else in the company, you end up focused on one vertical area. Our most successful companies had two or three founders. that's when the one comes along that breaks the rule. So we will consider anything and it is far worse to pick a bad co founder than to be a solo founder. Like 10 infinitely worse. That almost always blows up. Brexit and Trump and this populism sweeping Europe, is that the economic growth that we had for the last for several decades. And I think this is really important for democracy to function. I think if people In a world where the pie stays the same size and we have sub 2% real GDP growth, then we fight because for your life to get better, mine has to get worse. We're trying to reallocate the pie instead of grow the pie. And I think this is one of the few great threats to the systems and the values that we we care about. We're basically honorary English, know, in The US that that we all care about continuing. And I think because we think a lot more startups is really good for the world continuing to function well. And I think that economic growth that benefits everyone, we can talk about And we're asking the companies to sort of do the same weekly check-in a YC company would do. We're gonna have like a thing We've had lot a of trial and error and I think the right answer is like eight or nine days. And the companies get to hear from each other and that's really valuable. It may not translate as well online, but we're gonna try that too. There's just sort of like one moving part too many. In future years I expect there will be. a group of us started It was the first project that YC Research ever funded, this group called OpenAI. And at the time, I had with the benefit of hindsight, I knew I wasn't optimistic enough. And that the progress that we're seeing in machine learning I think OpenAI will do great work. We are trying to solve general intelligence. We're trying to build the algorithm for a program that is truly smarter than a human in every way and then figure out how to have that maximally benefit humanity. And that's why we're a nonprofit. We don't ever want to be making decisions to benefit shareholders. So that is one effort. And that is a very much a pure research nonprofit. in the shorter term, machine learning is going to remake basically every vertical. And that you're already seeing this with self driving cars and AI radiologists that are better than human radiologists and AI lawyers that are better than human lawyers. And basically, I think all repetitive work we have the technology today to a first approximation And that it's such an important transition that we thought for the first time ever we would do a vertical and say, you know what? These startups, Again, I expect that almost every job in a factory will be replaced by a robot in the next, let's say ten years. On the other hand, I don't think people working on assembly line have found their highest, most fulfilling calling. And I take the mindset of we owe it to society as a whole to retrain people whose jobs we displace. But if we can make them happier and have a better job and put their efforts, their talents to better use, be the future. I think technology is a lever on ability and a concentrator of wealth. You get more total wealth, but it's concentrated in fewer and fewer people's hands. I think we are not that far away from being able to eliminate poverty effectively worldwide, certainly in developed countries. I think we are not that that far away from being able to offer universal health care to everyone. And I think there are things that are, fifty years from now, will be basic human rights, like health care and enough food to eat and a place to live. it's going to feel like it. And I think I think the societal compact we will have is some version of a floor and no ceiling. So there will be trillionaires, but they will pay a ton of tax and there will be no poverty either. that there exists a version of basic income where people still are passionate, they still get the fulfillment and self worth and sense of purpose from it, from something they do even if it's not a traditional job, and that people still have an incentive to create new value and do new things and just continue to propel everything forward. As I currently see the world, I think the most likely good long term future is some version of Emerge. I think if you have the AIs and the humans and they're both trying to enslave the other and they both want the same thing, is sort of dominant species in the universe, that's bad. my current thought is that some version of a merge and this can go anywhere from plugging electrodes into our brain and literally merging or uploading our brains to a computer or just every person has a little chatbot that becomes an extension of their will in the same way that quality of life correlates with cost of energy. And every major breakthrough we have in terms of cost of energy leads to people's lives getting a whole lot better. or longer. And the and coming needs for huge amounts of energy for AI supercomputers. And I think we should pursue both. Probably one will be the 80% and the other will be 20. But I think it's really important that we we get there somehow. And this is like a program that's now able to edit itself. but I know they're gonna be big ones. And there are there are the again, the sci fi novel dystopias of people can now engineer really terrible synthetic pathogens. We can also hopefully engineer better medicines to treat those and we can edit our future offspring. We can edit single celled organisms to produce anything we like, that's what Minka Bioworks does. They can make you a molecule, a difficult to make molecule, by creating a gene and putting it into a bacteria and then growing a lot of that bacteria. So we can edit life. That's just an odd concept. And it it's one of these things that went from being science fiction to possible more quickly than our regulatory system can react. these are trends that we're gonna see a lot more of if we can't figure out what tech can do to make the future good for everyone. Not the small set of people that run startups. has just absolutely enormous influence in our lives. I talked earlier about the merge. Maybe it's already started. that decide what I get to see are, again, not physically part of me, but in a very real way they are part of me. And we have a huge responsibility as tech companies to think about that. The things that make a company's graphs go up into the right, the things that incite those passions in people are not necessarily the things that are best for our society. And there's the fake news issue, there's the filter bubble issue. But we better get serious really soon as a tech industry about doing things that unite us. We have learned that we can do things that divide us and have huge user engagement. short black mark in our history that yields a great response and is a rallying cry for people to come together. I am terrified of the alternative, so I don't I think in this desire to have everything be on one side or the other, we lose sight of the fact that sometimes people do something we really disagree with for some good reasons and some bad ones. I'm sure glad that, you know, Elon Musk is working with Trump. And I think I totally understand why founders or CEOs don't wanna oppose Trump. don't think there's a conflict in between saying, I understand there may be very good reasons that you voted for Trump and I support those, And these aren't inconsistent to me because any politician, any political movement is a complex And So the question is AI is hard and startups are hard. Are they somehow synergistically together too hard? AI is not like applying existing AI technology is not as hard as people think and there's always something that's hard about a startup. You know, a good startup always requires exactly one miracle. We are gonna have this special track and we will try to make available the tool sets, the resources, the compute, the data that AI companies need. But I don't Look, I I think great question. You wanna start a startup where you have a wave coming bigger than you that you can leverage And you are guaranteed one with the need for retraining. So we're actually going to put out a request for startups specifically for people that wanna offer job retraining because we know there's a huge market there and it's a really important societal question. So I think it's the right market to go after. In terms of the way to do it, We and and we understand people need that. So we don't offer general office space for our startups because we think that's really bad. We think that you wanna be alone just for your own startup. You need your own door, your own identity. startups, for hardware startups, although we don't have a big open plan shared office, we have like a number of deals set up where you can get free access to hopefully anything you would need. Next generation sequencing? Think Look, I think Bitcoin should win. Although the community is so toxic and dysfunctional, maybe it won't. But historically, anything that gets this big, because network effects are so powerful and order n squared working the way it does, it's better to say, well, this will probably be the platform that sticks and we are going to focus on building new applications on this. My sense is that's better, a better use of time. And I think within that very broad framework, there are so many good ideas that range from smart contracts to proof of identity to everything else that Well, I think there's two general schools of thought here. One is that you should just tax and redistribute and everyone as like a human right should get enough money to live on and have an opportunity to learn new skills and do whatever they want. And the other is that you should continue to trust capitalism and just there's plenty of jobs on the other side because humans figure out new things to do, human demand is unlimited, and we'll always want new things. you know, factories, but maybe not that different. And probably, we'll find all sorts of new stupid things to want and compete over and new ways to create status. And I think that's probably right. And so I think capitalism probably continues to work fine, although it's gonna be a rocky transition. The other point of view, of course, is that this is the last technology revolution. And that AI, because it's better than humans at everything or could be better than humans at everything, the world is really different. In which case, you do need something super different than what we tried before. And major societal priorities. If if it if we do end up in the redistribution path, if humans aren't better than computers at enough stuff, I think the one thing that's really important and we're trying to study in our basic income study is if people don't get the meaning and the social environment and the fulfillment and the respect that they normally get from their job, what new systems do we have to create when I was just starting out in my career, I was focused on making money or at least enough money that I could do whatever I wanted. And the moment I crossed that threshold, I honestly don't think about it much anymore. And at this point, it's like, do I wake up every day and do something I wanna do with people I wanna do it with that is that I believe is like somehow getting back to the world and making it better in some way where I think I can uniquely help. The times I'm happiest are when I'm doing something where I think if I don't do this thing, it's not gonna happen and it's important. know, like my partners kind of joke with me that I have a short attention span and then I just like wake up one morning and decide to hand over some big piece of YC to somebody else. But I do that so that I can work on new things once I feel like I've kind of gotten something in motion. I, you know, the thing that I've turned out to be good at is getting things started and and And that happens without a big effort. Sure. Current state of diversity in tech and how Y Combinator helps it. Well, look, I always think that if we can just do something rather than talk about it, we should do that. So, you know, we we have more women in our partnership and more to answer. I don't really know. I've studied this, but I haven't formed a conclusion that I have confidence is correct. I'm I'm very willing to admit that I have all kinds of bugs in my brain and I'm not very logical and How do you know when to hold onto an idea that's failing or let it go and pivot? It is hard to answer in the general case. I can usually answer it if I had sit down with you for twenty minutes. The the two general frameworks that I would think about, one is when you're out of ideas. If it's failing and you have more ideas, you can keep trying. If it's failing and you're out of any ideas that you really believe in, that's usually a good sign about when it's time to give up. Sure. The the question of work life balance is is very difficult. I think it works to have a startup and one other make a priority in your life and then some other medium sized ones. But But but the but no balance at all usually leads to burnout as well. So I think everyone finds balance in their own way and it's kind of this oscillating function that's never quite perfectly in tune, but but eventually gets closer to converging. In terms of characteristics, I think one thing that's important to learn, even if you're not naturally good at it, it's it's learnable, is being a good communicator. I I think I may have mentioned that as a characteristic, but for me and for most other people, it's a behavior. I'm not naturally a good communicator. And the ability to clearly communicate ideas is so important and so undervalued Most people don't have their own ideas. Most people are a regurgitation of other ideas they've heard. And I myself used to be like that. And I realized that I could make a mental effort and I could practice So first of all, an advice about advice or taking advice. You will often hear a lot of different opinions. First of all, almost no one knows what they're talking about. And second, there's often multiple ways to do things. The only thing that is disastrous is to let yourself continually get slingshot it around from one thing to the other. What you wanna do is listen to a lot of advice, The two choices usually you face are
