1: I felt like I really would have loved to go to school here. The thing that stuck out the most is that unlike where I went to school, I had to find a group of people who are interested in in building and creating new technology and not just sort of I think I'm I'm pretty sure this is accurate. I can't think of anything that we've even come close. I believe there are more Y Combinator alum companies within a kilometer of velocity than anywhere else in the world outside of the Bay Area. I have given talks like this many times. I have the most fun when it's mostly me answering questions. So I will talk, but please interrupt anytime you'd like. I'm happy to go in any direction. Whatever is most useful. I'd much rather be interrupted if I'm boring you or telling you something that is not helpful than I would to sort of waste your time on something you don't wanna hear about. Thank you very much. the question that I usually get when I'm anywhere other than Silicon Valley. Although, maybe a little bit less in Waterloo than than most places, which is what makes Silicon Valley special? Why how can we be like Silicon Valley? What do we need to do? And first of all, I think the most important thing is to not feel like you are any less impressive than people in Silicon Valley. I think people handicap themselves a lot by saying that, well, you know, I'm gonna grade on a curve and I need a few extra strokes in the golf game because I haven't. I'm not in Silicon Valley. Completely wrong, obviously. Talent is is equally distributed around the world. There may be more access to capital in Silicon Valley, but everything else is basically harder. It's harder to find office space. It's harder to recruit and retain engineers. So, I think the number one piece of advice that I always give people is get out of your own head about this. But but here are the things that I think are admirable about Silicon Valley. Many many things we do wrong. Here are some of things I think we do well and are worth trying to emulate. Fifteen years is a long time. Technology trends are these exponential curves. It's really easy to be building the future, be correct, but seem seem kind of very crazy, very out there, very focused on the wrong things in the present. And one of the challenges of this is if you're going to have this relentless belief in the future, if you're really going to truly think about the world thirty years out and try and then get to work on building the world that's fifteen years out, people are gonna mock you. And all all humans basically have this evolutionary drive not to like being made fun of, not to like being mocked. Know, you wanna fit in with your group. And one of the things that really works about Silicon Valley and one of the things that works about Waterloo too is that there is enough critical mass of people that do believe in the future that you can find people who won't mock you. You can find people who think it's okay to be ambitious, who think it's okay to be working on the problems of tomorrow, who think it's okay to be trying these things that sound like they're not gonna work today. Close to that is just you want to have some people, And I have I have found a group over the last decade plus of people like this for me. But I I have people that I can call up, you know, at 11:00 on a Friday night from a bar with a really crazy idea that sounds totally wild and completely nonsensical, and they will at least humor me. They will not immediately say that's dumb. They will say, well, let's think about how that could be good. Or, well, that sounds really bad, but maybe it's good for this reason. And most of the time they're just bad ideas. I don't know what the Canadian phrase for this is. Interestingly, in The US, we have no such phrase, but most countries do. I picked one from Australia called tall poppy syndrome. But this idea where if you try to be too ambitious, people try to cut you down. Is there a Canadian phrase for this? What is it? there's no American phrase for this that it's at least popular, and it's good that there's not an obvious one in Canada either. But I think it's really important to find a group of people who won't try to cut you down for saying, like, I'm gonna go build this giant company. Again, another really good thing about Waterloo, density really matters. Density is really, really important. Trying to be around, you know, a lot of other people working on startups in close physical and mental proximity is really important. So, people help you, and if you're successful, you are expected to pay it forward. And that's been great to see at running many of the startup related orgs and starting a new one, that happens in Silicon Valley as well. And I think that's that's a really good sign. So, another question is what our top 10 most successful founders would have said about themselves when we were interviewing them at YC. I always figure it out and I never give up. Would've been high on the list. And everyone thinks the thing that really matters is how smart they are, or their domain expertise, or their network, or their connections. It really is this kind of a personality trait. People have different phrases for that. Determination, relentlessly resourceful is one that Paul Graham uses. But that spirit is the most important factor, I think, in successful founders. You need to have everything else, but a lot of people have everything else. This, I think, is the kind of the rare and the limiting trait. The good news about this is I think people can kinda learn it. People don't try too often, but I think this is possible. Where if you apply yourself to getting better in this way and the way you do for anything else, I think people make huge strides. This is not this is not something that if you're not born with it, there's no chance. Three three things that we have observed about how successful founders get things done. Focus, self belief, and personal connections. These are this actually started something Charlie Rose said that he had observed that the way things people got the way people got things done in the world was a combination of focus and personal connections. And then for startups, I think it's really important to add this, you actually have to believe in yourself. You actually have to believe you might do it. But these three things, we've seen again and again. Because momentum is this crazily self fulfilling prophecy. And can they form the personal connections that it takes to be successful? Will they be able to recruit and retain a world class team? Will they be able to sell their product? Will they be able to raise money? Will they be able to talk to the press? The the the ability to form these personal connections is super important. Another thing that I did not used to believe was this important, and now I do, is clear communication. And vision and thought is part of that, but really clear communication. Almost all of the best startups that we have ever been involved with, from the very first time we met those founders, they were able to very concisely and clearly communicate what they were doing in like 25 words. And I don't know why this is so important, and maybe that you need this to spread the message, but I can certainly say that founders who aren't good at this don't really go on to be successful. Founders that don't get good at clear, concise communication really struggle. And you can you can prove this to yourself quickly by just looking at the founders of really successful companies. They're all good at this. So, I think this is an area to invest in and get better in. If you have those things, then one thing you can do is attract great people to work on the company with you, which is hard and important. It's really, really hard to recruit the twentieth employee for a startup. One thing that I always tell people is it is easier to start a hard startup than it is to start an easy startup. And the reason is you need a startup that is going to be inspiring. You need a startup that people are going to want to help you with. And if you are another startup that kind of fades into the noise and no one really cares that much about, maybe a fine business but it's just not exciting, it doesn't no one wants to contribute their energy to it. It's really it's really hard. Recruiting that twentieth employee is really hard. You need an exciting vision, and you need to be good at communication and personal relationships. And then also, founders just get a huge amount of work done themselves. So, in the early days especially, you kinda gotta do everything, and there's a lot to do. And so people that have this sort of like focus and maniacal productivity is really important. But there are a lot of good ideas in the world. There are far fewer people that are willing to put in the effort that it takes over years or decades to build a great company than there are people who have great ideas. That said, starting a startup with a bad idea is also bad. So, I'm happy to talk about this about how to have good ideas, but this is always what people want to talk about. A lot of people think if they could just come up with a good idea, then they can start a really successful company. We've run this experiment at YC. We funded 21 companies where the founders seemed really good, they didn't have an idea. good founders tend to have a lot of good ideas, and also good ideas without real commitment behind them are just tough. So, wait to have a good idea before you start a startup. If you start a startup without a good idea and you just kind of cast around for one, you'll be under pressure to make something up. It won't work that well. Startups, the very best startups, are all started because someone believes so passionately in an idea, and they believe that a startup is the best way to make that happen. One of the things that is really hard about good ideas is that original thought is really hard. Most people just copy somebody else's thoughts. Most people do what somebody else is doing. And this is disastrous because if you have one idea that starts to work and you have 10,000 clones that follow it, none of you are gonna be successful. And the person that started first that you all copied is very likely to win. You know, in the year after Facebook started, there were well over a thousand social networks that started. In the year after Instagram started, there were well over a thousand photo sharing apps that started. We have not seen the same Snapchat cloning race. I'm not sure why. But you you wanna do something that is new and different. You wanna think of an idea that's not the same idea everybody else is working on. The year that I joined the board of Helion, which is a nuclear fusion company, according to somebody's count, there were 10,000 photo startups of some sort or other started that year, and one nuclear fusion startup started, which seemed a little bit off to me. But I think most people just do what everybody else is doing right then. Noticing problems in your own life is is certainly a good way to do this. It's not true that all successful startups are starting to solve a problem that the founders have themselves, but it's a very high percentage. If you really go back and think about the transformational companies, And then, there's this idea of a great wave, which is that another thing you notice if you go back and look at all the really successful companies is there was this massive wave of technology coming. You could see it in the distance, and you knew it was gonna just like crash over the shore and through the city. And you got out there early on your surfboard. So I think it's really hard to create a technology wave as a startup. That takes too much, too many resources. You can't do that. But what you can do is notice that a wave is coming, and university students are particularly good at this. You can notice that a technological wave is coming. And while other people still think it's a toy or not gonna matter, you can really get conviction behind it and surf somebody else's wave. And this, by the way, So, you know, when the the Internet wave happened in the the mid to late nineties, you had a huge cluster of companies that are now very large. Amazon, Google, Yahoo, I guess, others. And and then when the mobile wave happened after the iPhone came out, 2007, 2008, you had this other big wave of Uber, Airbnb, Snapchat, Instagram, WhatsApp. In this short period of time right after this this new wave started. And so, a very good question to think about now. Facebook, I would say, kind of was the one that straddled both. They did really well on the Internet, and then they did even better on mobile. And a really good question to ask is what is the wave that's starting right now, and what will be you know, where is the cluster of companies? Because we're about due for another one. Where is that gonna be? We do have a significant preference for co founders. I think this is born out in the data. We are very happy to fund single founder companies. And I would guess, don't answer that, and I'll tell you why. I am equally likely to be right as wrong, but because you might listen to me, I could set you down, like, a terrible career trajectory, And I would feel very irresponsible if that happened. So you should not start the startup I wanna start. You should start the startup you wanna start, and you should trust your own convictions. You look younger than I am. You're more likely to be right. But, I mean, one that I am so sure I'm right about that I'm willing to say is I I do think machine learning applied to every vertical is as close to a guaranteed shot as you can have right now in startups. The problem is a lot of other people think that too, so it's brutally competitive. But there are going to be, you know, a $100,000,000,000 companies that get started around now applying AI to different verticals. So that's one that I that's one I feel confident enough about to say. you know, Amazon, I think, was basically a solo single founder company, and, obviously, that's been fantastic. It's clearly possible. And it is certainly a lot better to be a solo founder than to have a bad cofounder. I actually was dealing with this this morning. This is about the time in a y c batch when people that kind of came together as cofounders just so that they could get into y c and told us how they knew each other for a long time and made all that stuff up. This is where that all falls apart. So you really do want shared history with a cofounder. It is a very stressful thing. It's like a relationship. And if you don't have some goodwill built up in the bank, it's like if you start a relationship with the most stressful bad part. And you need that shared history. You need to feel like you owe each other something. And that way, at some point, the the expected value of most startups kind of dips below the x axis. And if the co founders feel like they're friends and they owe each other something, you can kind of get through it. As I mentioned earlier, this concept of determination, hugely important. And one mistake people make all the time when they select cofounders is to pick somebody who's really good at technology, domain expert, everything else good, but not determined. And that's very bad. In general, the hiring framework that has worked for me in my life has been to go for values first, aptitude second, and specific skills third. And I think this is particularly true for cofounders. The problem is that most people for regular hiring and especially for cofounders reverse this. You know, I need an engineer with a background in node and who has worked on iPhone apps. And then and then you really want people who are you want founders who are humbled who are humble and not entitled. Companies end up being reflections of their founders. The culture of the the the founder set is what will the company's gonna look like for a long long time. And I think a very common mistake that people make is to assume that, well, you know, this founder I saw in this movie that is probably not even that based on reality was really arrogant, so that's how to be successful. So that's how I'm gonna come across. Turns off everybody. Poisonous to the culture. know, like closer to my side of the sort of ASPE scale than somebody else, say, you know what I need is like a really outgoing, kinda arrogant cofounder because that's what success looks like. And, really, Everything that I said before except the determination and the self belief has to be even higher. The way it normally works when you have two founders or three founders is there'll be days where, like, one person's kinda down and kinda wants to give up, but the other person is, like, feeling really good and saying, we're gonna do this. Don't worry about it. And you pull the other person up, and then the next day it reverses. But the problem is if you're by yourself and you're going through the sine wave, when you're in the downs, you just end up giving up. There's nobody to pull you up. So we really look for people that have, like, incredible internal, almost at the co founder bar. You really want people that are going to believe in the mission, that share your values, and that are just super talented, super high aptitude at whatever they do. I I have almost never gone wrong in my career hiring people who are inexperienced at a specific domain, but super committed and super talented at everything else they've done, and trusting that, you know, maybe they'll be a little bit less productive for the first month, but they'll come up to speed quickly. You know, the leaders that I've hired for the different parts of my organization, But I am not one of these people who can say, I wanna work with you an hour every day for the next ten years based off of two one hour meetings. you know, spend many hours sitting together in the office. I hire really slowly and I try to do it gradually as well. So like if you're gonna be a partner at YC, we've developed this process where it's basically like a year long. You know, first you come in and you do office hours with some companies. And then if those go well with companies like you, if a number of partners that have sat in with you like you, then we're gonna make you a part time partner for six or twelve months, where you're kind of like like a partner, And then if that goes well, we're gonna sort of like we have this sort of six month trial partner period. We don't screw up that much once we actually make you a partner, but we have a long time to get there. And So that's the thing that's worked for me. There are people who kind of make these one hour snap decisions. We do it for y c companies. We decide very quickly, but most of them don't work out anyway. We're not, you know, we're not with them every day, so it's different. This happened for sure as well. But, you know, most of the partners at Y Combinator have not been investors before this job. And in so I'll give you here's a specific example. A couple of years ago, we decided that we were gonna start a growth fund. Although I'm an investor, I am basically financially illiterate. I you know, like, there are these people who can, like, build a model And, you know, like, I can I don't know the shortcuts in Excel? We had, you know, we had been investing super early, and now all of a sudden we're gonna be investing, you know, 50 plus million dollars at a time at a late stage in YC companies. And we had to go off and figure out how we find professional limited partners because we need way more money than we'd ever deployed before. And everyone's advice was the thing you need is to hire a growth equity finance person. Everyone's advice. Even my own partners, but certainly like everyone outside. And they're like, there's no other option. No one will give you money without this. You need a seasoned investor with a big track record. It's a different world. You need someone that's gonna wear like cufflinks and suits and the whole thing. a 100% of them failed the the values test. And, aptitude test as well. They did have the experience. But any of those people that I brought into the organization to lead this very important new group that we have was gonna be a big compromise on values. Everyone I met. Thought about that thought about that, and I was like, know what? We're not gonna do this. So, the guy we ended up hiring for this, I had never been an investor before in his life at any stage. But he had absolutely no experience But I didn't like any of them. I didn't think any of them weren't gonna have good values alignment with what we're about as an organization. So, we hired someone that had absolutely no experience in what we're doing, and he's worked out fantastically well. Built a great team, you know, was able to sort of get in more junior people that specific domain experience. But he understands very fundamentally what we do and why, and has built a wonderful organization in service to founders in the same way that we do it at a later stage that I don't believe any of the traditional growth investors would have done. I think that many people who have run start ups have understood what that's like. I was doing okay. So I was always I'm always skeptical of founders who say, like, I have no experience myself, but I will only hire people with twenty years of experience. disconnect there. So, yeah, I I was always willing to you know, there there have been again, there have been times where really specific domain expertise about something is important. You know, like I wouldn't hire a non lawyer and say, okay, you'd be general counsel. But but in general, I think taking a bet on people has has paid off for me. Yeah. It's a great question. It's definitely hard. One of the best pieces of advice someone gave me when I asked that that same question when I was starting my career is And so to be taken seriously. And then when someone said that's just not realistic, that's not gonna happen, so find a few people, realize it's gonna take longer, and get really good ones, and it's better to like hire two or three great people than 10 warm bodies. And, you know, like, still, we're always behind our hiring plan. Every year, YC is always behind our hiring plan. The CEO is supposed to run the company. And I think if the CEO is doing a bad job, But beyond that, the CEO is supposed to make the decisions and the board is supposed to, you know, be a sounding board, advice and consent. And I don't so, like, do I think a board should fire a bad CEO? Yes. And I know that's like a little bit heretical in Silicon Valley. Beyond But I and I've had good board members. I've had bad board members. I have board members now, but we don't we've never had a board meeting. to help guide you, but we'll respect that it's your company. You're gonna make the decisions. But every good cofounder dynamic I have seen, and by that I mean like where all the cofounders actually stay at the company, there's huge compromise. And even if one person is a CEO, which they are, is kind of aware of what everybody else feels most strongly about, and there's huge compromise. Because, you know, it's like the cofounders own the company together, and they should be running it together to some degree. And the whole like, the dynamic you see sometimes where the relationship between co founders starts really good, but then someone kinda gets power drunk on being CEO and their investors, their board's telling them it's their show. The other co founders and then kind of compromise goes out the window. The other co founders almost always leave. And in all of the good long term relationships, I think there's really good compromise. Sometimes it's really bad, and sometimes it's really good. I mean, there are definitely times when a cofounder should leave. There are definitely times when someone is just, So I think that depends on the specifics. You know, nothing lasts forever forever. But if you can have, like, a really good co founding team together for ten or twenty years, that's that's quite valuable. Brian is unbelievable at this. Brian is like every time I leave Airbnb I was over there yesterday. Every time I leave Airbnb, It's, like, so inspiring. He's, like, talked so clearly about he's, like, so good at making Airbnb feel important, you feel important. It's, like, politician level of of of skill about that. genuine people. And so I think if you can if you are not naturally super charismatic, which definitely I am not and many other people aren't either, I think you can go a really long way by just being genuine in your beliefs, your intentions, and also your willingness to help others. I think if you just, like, go out of your way to help people even if there's not an immediate transactional value to you, that that develops really good relationships over a long period of time. But I think if so I've times helped someone even though the kind of immediate thing I was trying to do with them didn't work out. And it, like, has been unbelievably good for me years later when I've gotten to invest at a company in a company that has now gone on to be super successful, or they've joined YC as a partner or something else. So I think a long term focus on, hey, this person seems really great, and there's not an immediate thing, but I'm gonna do whatever I can to help them and trust that it'll somehow lead to some value creation years down the road is good. I think genuinely being excited about what you're working on and trying to get other people excited about that rather than, like, this fake whatever sales tactic stuff people do works really well. You know, that that is the decision that founders get paid to make. It's it it is different in every specific case. Probably, yes. But it really depends on the specific thing. I don't this probably isn't his original idea, but he he talks about this idea of the magic moment. The one thing that people use a product and they love it so much. That that's why they tell their friends about it. Airbnb talks about not how do you get to a three or a four or five star experience, but how do you get to an 11 star experience. Like, what is the most comically ridiculous thing they can imagine that they can never do, but maybe they can go back from that and get you to a six star experience. So, yes, I generally do think trying to figure out what is the one magic moment, what is the one thing that's gonna be so good about this, people will spontaneously tell their friends to buy it, is important. I do believe this though, by the way, that A piece of advice that my partner, Paul Buhide, gives is that it is more important to have a small number of users that love you, rather than a large number of users that like you a lot or like you a little. And I think this is one of the most important counterintuitive And the latter is the one that works, almost always. And that's a counterintuitive and an important point. Yes? I think it generally is useful to overcommunicate on these things and generally say, you know, per person one is gonna be responsible for things x, y, and z. Person two is gonna be responsible for things a, b, and c. And then when we get to the big strategic disagreements of the entire business, we're gonna resolve them the following way. and we have a lot of rules like that in place at y c. So there's like a class of things that any partner can do by him or herself. There's a class of things you can do if it's your domain. So we have one partner responsible for software, one for recruiting, one for, you know, finance, one for legal, one for operations. And then there are a class of things that require the entire partnership to vote as a whole. And those don't come up very often because there's 18 of us, and really painful to make a decision with 18 CEOs sitting around a table. So we don't do those often. But if we're going do something like raise that new growth fund that I talked about earlier, like, that one requires the whole partnership to get together. And so we have set these frameworks, and it lets us work. I think we're probably the biggest venture investing partnership I I think it's always really dangerous to sort of say we could do these 17 different things, and we have no internal conviction about which to do. I think it is like I subscribe to the strong ideas weekly held approach of startups. Like, there's one idea of those that I believe will be the best. And I think the other extremes the extremes are both wrong, You know, we wonder about that. I think less than people think. So we we have tried a number of different configurations. But right now, the current one is the hard tech companies. They go through YC just with the software companies. And they always come in saying, I can't get anything done in ninety days, and they always leave saying, I cannot believe how much I got done in ninety days. I think too often, And that focuses people, and it means they get something done. And they almost always will say that was the most productive ninety days of my life. So I think as a general rule, the hard tech companies should look more like software companies. And it's generally a bad excuse when they say they can't. And, you know, we have just had result after result after result in very different fields of people that thought they couldn't do anything on a three month time frame being shocked at how much they could get done. So also on the phone recently with a company called Ginkgo Bioworks, they had existed for seven years before y c, then they did y c. And the founders said to me that if they had just done y c initially, they could have compressed that initial seven years into one year. And so I think you have to move fast no matter what business you're in. Like, everyone kind of wishes they didn't have competitors. That would be nice. But if you're doing something interesting, other really talented people are going to be trying to do the same thing. They can work smarter or faster or harder or all of those than you. And you the way you beat them is to just have super talented people working on a very fast iterative cycle. If I think I'm always interested in exponential curves, This first one is the idea of how quickly your product gets better. So if let's say on every iteration cycle, your product gets 10% better on average. If your iteration cycle is a week and your competitors is three months, you you're gonna leave them in the dust very quickly. And the reason that I think most hard tech startups fail is their iteration cycle is three months, which basically rounds to infinity and they lose momentum and die. That's that's really important. The other kind of exponential trend that is very related to that point, I think you should work really hard in the beginning of your career. One of the things that I no one told me, and I later realized to be true, is that studying and working hard, it it pays off like compound interest. And if you do that in your late teens and early and mid twenties, you have many working years ahead for the benefits of that compound interest to pay off. And if you wait and do that until you're in your fifties or sixties or seventies, you just have less working years left for that to pay off. And so Momentum is really important. Momentum is self sustaining. And one way to have momentum is to be growing really fast. Another way to have momentum is just to have continual breakthroughs in the lab. But that's not most hard tech startups, and I have met many and been involved with some of the best ones in the last few years, most of them just honestly don't move that fast. yes, it takes more effort to identify a fast moving company if you can't just look at a graph of daily active users, but it is possible. And I have found the more time I spend visiting these companies in these labs, I can identify pretty quickly if it's a fast moving company or not. I can usually go to one weekly research meeting and have a pretty good pretty good guess. And investors are not wrong. They that is really important. You really do need that. And the question is, how do you evaluate it if it's an area you're not familiar with? You know, I I I try to sit down with every hard tech startup that comes into YC at the beginning of our program and figure out what their goal for the end of the program should be. And, you know, like, there's a lot of people who are willing to engage in a genuine open brainstorm with me and come up with something that they think is a little bit too aggressive, but they're willing to try. And there are some people who are just like, nope, I can't make I can't hit the next milestone for the next three years. There's no intermediate milestone that makes any sense. That's just how long it takes. You don't understand science. Okay. They always fail. The you know, like, one particular company the we funded them in January 2014. This was before self driving cars were cool. This is an example of the kind of class of ideas that all investors say they don't like. that could drive itself down the highway from San Francisco to Mountain View. And with, you know, computers hanging out the back and but it drove itself ninety days later. And he raised some money, Every week, their car was getting better on the roads. So I made my biggest investment of the year in that company. And then, like, seven months later, GM acquires them, giant acquisition. Every investor that passed This is the future. But but had people been willing to just do the work and look at how quickly that company was progressing, Even though it wasn't obvious externally from, like, a daily active users chart, they would have invested. And the problem is that most hard tech companies aren't in fact progressing quickly. Way more went right than wrong there. So I but not until here. So, I think this would really benefit my number one piece of advice and number one piece of advice for most pitches is that you need investors or anyone you're pitching, this comes down to the clear communication, to understand what you're doing in, like, the first minute. And it's always tempting And you eventually want to help low income people have access to high quality medical care by using computers. And you can say that at the end of the presentation, but you really just want to tell people very clearly upfront, this is what we do. And it's okay if this is what you do today and you're going to do a lot more later. Cause what you do today is plenty revolutionary. It's plenty big. So, right after this one, that says in one simple to understand sentence, you know, something like, It'd be great. But, like, you know, this is less important to me even if I didn't know it than knowing that you have built something that without a bio just purely visually with a computer can diagnose skin cancer better than the best human doctors. That's what you should be talking about in slide two. This as well, this was a hard slide for me to follow. I love the message, which is that there's a huge error rate. This one again, helpful, but so early on in the presentation, I would rather be hearing about That's all more important than this. I think it's as important in a pitch what you leave out as what you say. And this is valuable, but it's just not as valuable as the burning questions that an investor will have. wouldn't be as interesting to me as you telling me, okay, so we have this thing. Here's the data that proves it works. And here is basically a road map of the next two years of what we have to do to get this in the clinic and to start making revenue and to start impacting people's lives. this is good. This is where you're actually showing the product. This makes it seem way more real to people when you're actually doing something. And then you can get into all the rest of this. These slides, I think, are always terrible. I have never seen one of these where the start of presenting is not in the upper right. And this one again, like, it's fine, but I've never ever seen a slide where someone says we're a small market. So, I think what would be really helpful here is we have created this revolutionary technology. It's gonna have this huge impact. And here is how we're gonna get it into the 90,000 clinics. That was for me the biggest thing missing. There's other things I changed the emphasis on the order, but the big outstanding question for me at the end of this was, okay, like, what what do the next two years look like? What does winning look like? What are you gonna go do now? What needs to happen? And I think if you reorder things to talk about what you do clearly at the beginning, that it works, then tell me about the product. Everyone understands the need and the problem. And then spend the rest of the presentation with something that doesn't exist yet today, which is how do you go from here to a multibillion dollar company that impacts a lot of people? every night before I go to bed for the next day. And I have like three big ones at the top, and then a long list of like 50 little ones, like calls for turn and stuff. So like, the morning is really important to me to get creative work done, or to just get, like, high throughput work done where I really have to focus. And I have been in that I have had the same productivity system of Blue Origin is something like step by step ferociously, Another is that economic growth is central to a functioning democracy, And now we don't. And because people are sensitive to relative differences in quality of life but not absolute differences, if you don't feel your own life getting better every year, you are understandably unhappy. Or if you see your neighbors, if you're on the wrong side of the wealth inequality That's a very central value to me. You know, having The US continue to survive and
