Unknown: He I I will tell you, it took considerable effort for Sam to do this. He is, I'll just say, halfway around the world. So I wanna thank you for doing this for for me and for us me just tell the audience a little bit from a perspective that they will understand. Please allow me to embarrass you a little bit. But that's about as as as about as fancy as he gets, An early investor in Airbnb, Stripe, Reddit, He's now launched OpenAI, a research company that wants to use digital intelligence to benefit, not harm humanity. I've often said, Sam, that we're sitting in a moment in history, So before you comment on this discussion about humanity and AI, artificial intelligence, in Middle America at a conference with Shetra, my wife, and we're hearing this young man, Sam and I never talked about this. We're hearing this young man who's younger than Sam a rocket that he wants to design through three d. they met in a coffee shop, and the guy pitches them on the idea and I think the guy wanted And if I get this story right, this is a three d rocket, three-dimensional again, true believer that they developed a rocket in a basically, warehouse in a month and that company now is being hosted, if I get this right, Sam, at NASA, has a launch pad, and has been given access to thousands of acres of government endorsed and supported technology at NASA from an idea on the back of a napkin at Starbucks. as I understand it in, basically a month's time. Yeah. I'm connecting this now to your vision about AI because both of these require you to see around corners. So help help the audience to understand. Those who wanna be like you, those who wanna emulate your success,
Sam Altman: I I think that the world needs a lot of this right now. You know, our vision at OpenAI is, we think this new technology is coming that is gonna be a bigger deal than anything before. It's gonna change our whole world. We're gonna have computer programs that can think, come up with new ideas like a human, smarter than any human. And, you know, we wanna make sure that happens in the good way, not the bad way. There's plenty of scary versions of that, but there's incredibly great ones too, where we all have more abundance and better tools and services than we can ever imagine before. And, is it is easier to start a hard company than it is to start an easy one. People really get excited to help you if you're gonna do something very ambitious. People wanna join that company, work at that company, fund it, be around it. And so my my advice to everyone thinking about it is don't don't be afraid of your most ambitious ideas. Those are
Unknown: So for what that mentor did for you,
Sam Altman: like, I can't believe what an important secret it is, that startups work. They can change the world. They're the best way to create wealth for yourself, for communities. They're the best way to make new things happen.
Unknown: and rural communities waiting to be tapped also?
Sam Altman: found out or kinda believed in. A way that, like, the you know, talent is evenly distributed throughout the entire world, but opportunity is not. And I think one of the magic things that Y Combinator showed
Unknown: And, hopefully, the answer inspires others to follow your lead as they come up as a young successful person. Number two, I wanna talk about AI and why you believe this can be a force
Sam Altman: I found in my own experience that, you know, not only do I like acting that way, but it always seems to work out the best. And on the comment about AI, like, look. I think it's very understandable to be scared. And I think if people aren't a little bit scared, they're not paying attention. You know, we're we're talking about creating something that is more powerful than any of us in a way, and we're talking about something that can do sort of one of the things that is the most human of all all of our capabilities. The reason we started the organization is that the stakes here are so high. This can be either incredibly good or incredibly bad. So you know, causes harm, that's obvious. But there's other versions where, you know, it, like, distorts the algorithms online and convinces people of bad things or it sort of incites violence or it makes us just feel bad about ourselves or who knows what else. Like, we we've seen recently how technology that wasn't intended for anything negative can be used with with quite bad effects. But the upside here is huge, We also wanted to be able to make sure that we could do all the safety research that we needed. We didn't have, like, the pressures of having to, like, profit and be part of a big company so that we don't end up in that bad direction. So lots to be scared of, but on the other side, like, I think we can imagine a world where everyone gets a great education, everyone gets great medical care, everyone can have, like, beautiful houses. We have tools that can, like, make us maximally effective, maximally enjoy our life. I think it's, like, hard to imagine how how good this technology can be on the outside. a very important and difficult collective humanity wide conversation
Unknown: to talk about the future. How do you think AI will change the economy? And what should everybody watching this forum be paying attention to that they're not?
Sam Altman: So I think that's, like, an example of how it's difficult. But I think that what we're seeing so far is that AI is creating these tools that can't replace humans, but they're good in different ways than humans. So we released a product called Codex that can help a human write code. And maybe that human coder cannot be twice as productive So I think that's all really good. The the stuff that excites me about the future, you know, AI the most. I do and then the other categories are And then with crypto, I think that is both a new financial system and a new governance system that most people are still underestimating. And to our point earlier about needing to get input from the whole world and how technological change happens and impact society and not just the few people that happen to work at these companies,
