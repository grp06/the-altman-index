Unknown: because he does do hallucinate hallucinations or whatever they are. Let's go. Hey, Dan. Thank you for doing this. Appreciate it. And we'll talk about all the Chegg stuff later. I had the opportunity to request questions from the folks here. There were a lot of them. Great. for those of you who don't know, Sam is the a little chat. So Sam, given the breakthroughs that you have been working on over the years, Second, what should we be excited about? what would you be focused on now to help the next generation who's walking into the AI revolution?
Sam Altman: I think I'll I'll go a little bit out of order there because it'll slow better. What we should be excited about is this is one of those technologies that comes along that has the ability to massively increase quality of life in ways that are hard to imagine. And I I used to think about the world as many different technological revolutions. Now I think it's all like one big exponential. And I don't wanna make too much of this moment because I think it's just something that fits in with everything else, but it is somehow a noteworthy milestone that we can now put intelligence or something that feels like intelligence into computers. but the software is so good now that we can do a lot of transformative things, One of the things that I personally find most gratifying is what is happening with education. We've seen And and now we're seeing, like, act three of that where it's actually teachers that are driving forward use of ChatGPT in education the most. And we hear all the time from teachers doing incredible new things in their classrooms. They they've never seen students learning so fast. Students that they really thought were struggling are now getting, like, personalized custom tutoring all these different ways. And it's actually been the teachers that have led to the reversals of some of the chat GBT bands in different school districts earlier and really just amazing innovation.
Unknown: So in in in the spirit of that, the next question I have is a workforce question. So what we know are the facts up to this point, which is there are more Americans that have ever been before and there's more jobs than they've ever been before. And so technology may have eliminated some jobs, but it's created overall more jobs. People are worried about that now as you've just sort of articulated. So if you were entering the workforce today, Sam, what would you prepare yourself for given the AI revolution is in fact here now?
Sam Altman: and also prepare myself for a high rate of change in the world and and sort of a lot of you know, growing up with ChatGPT or getting very used to ChatGPT is that you hear again and again, like, I can learn things so new things so quickly. And I think this,
Unknown: and, you know, in in the last ten years, there was this debate which is should we teach everybody STEM and should everybody be an engineer? And now it's likely that engineers may be some of those areas that need to learn new capabilities. How should we be thinking about STEM, math, engineering given the capabilities of the technology now to do some of these things for us already and probably more so in the future.
Sam Altman: And, you know, the industrial revolution, people say, well, what what will humans ever do? And it turns out with better tools,
Unknown: the move towards I mean, five years ago, 45% of the people took engineering and STEM in college. Now it's 55%. Do you think engineering is is the place to do it or would you focus on data science or would you focus on something else as a capability? Because when you say get familiar with the technology, you know, there was a question for a pause, the appause, which I think would be insane because the technology is here and someone's going to do it and better better to be us. But there's also ethical questions that people are gonna ask that we've never really been faced with. Right? It's not that something is ethical or unethical on in itself as it relates to a technology, but we know the history of the world is bad people tend to do bad things faster than good people tend to do good things. And so do you think what do you think the ethical challenges are? And I know you've called for government regulation with AI. And given what we learned about the Facebook era of their their I guess they were not really aware of what the possibilities could be. And I think we all experience what they've become, some of what Mike showed earlier about, you know, the way people feel about themselves. So what do you think the big ethical challenges are? How are you and your team going about thinking them through?
Sam Altman: We spent eight months after we finished g p t four before we released it to the world. And in that time, we were red teaming it. We were aligning it. We were trying to make it safer. We were having external audits. We were working with public policymakers to try to find where the problems are. And it's been very gratifying that people, even people who have been very skeptical of us in the past, have said, you know, wow, OpenAI has released a more aligned, model than ever before. And I think that is what needs to happen. As these models get more and more powerful, we need higher standards for safety and alignment and how we're gonna evaluate dangerous capabilities than than we've had before. And the hard part of that is, as you said, not everyone is a good actor.
Unknown: how do you feel about different age groups interacting with AI at this point? Do you do you have any thoughts on that in terms of you know, should should anybody at any age that has the capability start using it, or do you have concerns over it? Or are you guys gonna put in any any, you know, parental protections or anything like that on the table?
Sam Altman: Yeah. I think children should use it, you know, with permission and sort of oversight of their parents. Maybe we can make a kid mode that would be safe enough, but we don't we certainly don't have it yet.
Unknown: It's very new. So I think people are just trying to get a sense, Sam, of how you think about it. I've had the good fortune to know you and know your ethics and your values and and you've walked me through just how much you're holding back so that the world can get used to it. So
Sam Altman: contact with this and input and insight into what's happening so that we can have a discussion and figure out what we want the limits to be, what the good parts are, what the bad parts are. And and so we do deploy this early. We call it iterative deployment because we want
Unknown: you're in a position to make those decisions now. And Facebook was in a decision in a position to make those decisions a while back and we saw the lessons from the choices they made. I don't know who would have made different or better choices. It's easy to do it after the fact. Right? So do you have you have a council of advisers? Do you work like who at the government? How do you think about because we're gonna learn things that we didn't even know we were gonna have to learn. Yeah.
Sam Altman: understandable, people get way more joy and value out of the current
Unknown: Yeah. I think the thing that amazes me is the speed in which people have adopted. It's the fastest product ever to have over what, a 150,000,000 users.
