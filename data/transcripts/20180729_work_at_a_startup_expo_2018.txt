Unknown: until Jared reminded me. It's been three times, actually four, at least. And, why you should but also why you shouldn't join a startup. And I'm gonna start with why you shouldn't join. feelings that I have to help you make an informed decision. But there's lots of lots of good reasons why you shouldn't shouldn't join a start up. Number one, the management at start ups generally really sucks. And as kind of a corollary to that, it is likely that if you join a startup, especially in early stage one, you won't necessarily get enough mentorship or direction on what you're doing unless you really actively force people to give it to you. Second reason, you are likely to not actually get rich joining a startup. That's statistically improbable that if you think you're gonna join a startup and then be set for life, that is unlikely to happen. One of the things that I think has changed is people, know, originally when I got here, think people just want to work on interesting shit and it was a much smaller number of people. Now I think that there's a lot of people who come to Silicon Valley because it's a great career and there's a great trajectory and there's stability and if you want like those things you should not join a startup. we don't have five years of money. So my example actually comes from that very first workforce startup eight years ago. You know, I was on stage talking about Justin TV, we actually recruited someone from that. And his name was Guillaume. And actually, he came to work for a startup and got two offers from two different companies. One was Justin TV and one was actually Scribd, Jared's company. he accepted and he joined Justin TV and within a year he was running our entire Rails backend for a site that was like a top 100 site and I think a top 10 to 20 Rails site at time. It was like in 2010, so the bar was a lot lower. and got an even greater scale challenge when they scaled to, like, from zero to a 128,000,000 users in, like, two months. And so, you know, just the rate of learning for him was, like, pretty incredible, and he's gone on to now he's a cofounder at a company called Triplebyte that does recruiting for YC companies and others. Okay. So that's number one. You are going to get access to jobs you are not qualified for. Number two is joining a startup is a really good gateway to starting your own startup if that's a goal of yours. In the second work for a startup, we in 2012, I came back with with another company called Exec, and I recruited someone else, actually, someone really talented. His name is Finbar, and he was an engineer at Groupon at the time. And I think he really wanted to break into starts with the idea of eventually starting his own. And I think one of the things that's really important is just put yourself in positions where you're around people who wanna do the things that you wanna do or or people who are like the person that you wanna become. One of my cofounders of Twitch, his his name is Emmett, has always told me that, you know, you are the average of your five closest friends. He wasn't talking about just me. He was talking about everybody in general. And I I really think that's the case. So as Finbar went on, he was like, you know, working at exec. That company didn't work out super good, but he ended up meeting a cofounder there and starting a startup, which was a horrible idea. It was a terrible idea. Told him not to do it at the time. But he ended up getting a start. Right? He was like he became a founder. That didn't work out. He ended up joining YC for, I think, just over a year, and then started a new startup that just went through YC and is off to the races and doing super good. Okay. So starting your own startup. That's the second reason. The third thing is to maximize is to maximize your own speed of learning. I think this is actually the most important reason why you should join a startup And I have kinda two examples of of people who had who did that working working with me, and they are both the two cofounders of Cruise. And I I think that they're cool examples because one is kind of maximizing learning on the way up and the other on the on the way down. And I'll explain what that means. So the first cofounder of Cruise, his name's Kyle Voatte. We recruited him at Justin TV in the early days to for his like the the month long break during January, And Kyle Kyle basically became our VP engineering. And he became a cofounder actually in in the VP engineering. And Kyle's an amazing hacker. He's always has been very amazing tinkerer and and one of those people with a can do attitude. He's just gonna, know, if you're like, hey. Let's build this thing. He's gonna go figure out how to build it. But he didn't know jack shit about scaling systems or building, you scalable system architectures. And so that was like the job that was available, though as soon as we stopped, we figured out that we should not build hardware. And so that was that's the the job we kind of assigned him, and he had to figure it out really, like, on the fly. And so he ended up, you know, packing this live video system. There was nothing kind of there was nothing there was there was there was, like, no precedent. Right? We we basically built this scalable, dynamic live video system that he engineered and architected mostly badly at first, actually, and it would went it would go down all the time. We ended up there was this one kind of funny story where, you know, we had no idea about like, we did no idea how to build reliable systems. And so every time it would go down, we would, like, call him, which was, like, every, like, thirty six to forty eight hours. And He ends up he went to Tahoe or something like that. We ended up Luckily, he had left the address. We ended up having to order a pizza to go to his house to read a message to him, a pizza delivery driver So like that was like our concept of like a pager system at the time. Right? The end of the story is he eventually architected this live video system that by the time Twitch sold to Amazon in 2014 was the fourth largest bandwidth consumer in North America, 15 points of presence around the world, did 90 petabytes of data transfer a month. And so, The other cofounder of Cruise was my brother, Daniel, who met Kyle actually as a intern at Justin TV when he was a a college student. We recruited him, not really recruited, it was more like nepotism. had a like crash course in in startups over the next couple years. Didn't work for me for very long but when he did work for me, he he recruited these guys to the site. I remember Justin TV when we were doing, like, the kinda live streaming site. He recruited this this unknown band. It was called the Jonas Brothers, and they they ended up, like, crashing our site. I mean, they were part of the reason that Kyle hated his life, ended up crashing the site over and over again. But the cool thing was he joined as this intern who got to, like, you know, interact and and kind of, like, make a deal with, like, what was basically, like, became the number one kinda teen band at the time in in 2007. And then later on, you know, he joined me as a, cofounder when I started this other company, Exec, in 2012. And the cool thing, you know, I mentioned that, you know, Kyle's kind of the example of, like, how you might learn at a startup as the start's growing and on the way up. I think Daniel's a perfect example of how you will also learn and maximize your learning if the startup is completely and horribly failing. Because we in 2013, by the time we had worked on exec for a couple years, we realized that the home cleaning business is not a great business. I recommend you don't join a home cleaning startup. a deal with a company called Handy that's in the East Coast and against all odds has survived in this industry. And we negotiated the deal and I'm I'm like, it was taking forever. There was, like, tons of lawyers. It was dragging and dragging and dragging, and I was so burned out. I was just like, I'm going on vacation, Daniel. You have to deal with it. It's not a very responsible thing to do but while I was in Thailand. I mean I was like kind of doing stuff on the phone but he was mostly like running this deal for not a lot of money, you know, just a a bit of of stock from Handy. And he ended up like it was, a horrible experience. He learned all about, like, negotiating, you know, from and and when you wanna have leverage in a deal, when you, you know, when you should, like, all the things all the different minutiae of negotiating a deal. And he lured on this very small horrible deal, which we were mostly just trying to offload because we were, like, we're so burned out. We wanna get out of the business. Two years later, fast forward two years, he had become a cofounder of Cruise. Cruise had built an amazing technology team that was executing super well. And, you know, you guys know the end of the story. They end up selling to GM for a billion dollars, and he applied the cool thing, I think, is that Daniel applied all of those horrible lessons he learned from, like, trying to negotiate this shitty piddling deal for our company to his next company and ended up you know, they sold it for over a billion dollars. So you're gonna learn something. Whether the company succeeds or fails, you'll probably walk away with something valuable. The last thing I'll say is that the way I think about it is from a quote that our YC partner Paul Buhite had generally said, I think he says it to every batch, which is that, you know, it's not your y intercept, but it's your slope that's important. And so I think you wanna you know, the way I've I've always thought about it is how do I figuring out ways that I can put myself in the position to maximize my own personal rate of growth and rate of learning. And I suggest that you do the same regardless of whether that's at a start up or not. Alright. up wait. I'm supposed to introduce you. I'm sorry. I forgot. Next, we have YC president, Sam Altman.
Sam Altman: making one big investment. If you're really good, you are going to take way less cash comp you can than you could get at Google or Facebook. for me at least, learning to invest in start ups was deeply counter intuitive. And I'm gonna talk about eight things that I learned about how to evaluate startups for investment. This mostly applies to sort of the stage of startups you'll see here today. Number one. This is a Paul Buhite, another Paul Buhite ism. It's more important that a startup have a small number of users that really love the product rather than a lot of users that really like the product. Most startups either have no one who cares at all or a lot of people who are kinda like, yeah, that's okay. Very rare to find a startup where people love the product so much they spontaneously tell their friends. If But you think about the really big companies today, Google, Facebook, you probably heard about it because someone was like this is awesome, you gotta sign up. And you know people talk about product market fit, all this other stuff, I think it's sort of hard to evaluate. But one thing you can do is either like talk to some users of the company or ideally you are one yourself or know some and like is this product so good that people are telling other people they've got to use it? And that I think matters much more than the vanity metrics number of users, current growth rate, whatever that most startups Momentum is sort of this really important concept to startups. If things are feeling good, if it's growing, if people are loving the product, if good people are joining, that tends to keep going. And if that falters, it's very hard to get it back. So does the startup have a good sense of momentum and is there some sort of exponential growth model? By the way, I've been investing in startups for like, I don't know, eight or ten years now. I still have not managed to get good at intuiting exponential growth in my head. So I have to do it in a spreadsheet every time. The size of the market today matters almost not at all. It is the the growth rate of the market and how big the market will be in ten years. So I think the number one mistake investors make when they miss out on a really great opportunity is they look at the size of the market today. Now they only care about how fast the startup is growing, they don't care about the size of the revenue today. And why they can't make this same leap of faith for the market, I've never understood. But if you make a really great decision on what startup to join, it will probably be a smallish market today that's growing really quickly. You know, I saw this morning on the way down here, this is like the ten year anniversary of the iPhone app store. So ten years ago, not very long, the size of the market for iPhone applications was $0. And a lot of investors, you know, somewhat rationally but obviously wrongly said, alright, well, we're not investing in these iPhone apps because this is a small market. I also saw this morning the Uber deck when they first raised money and they said, you know, their TAM is like $2,000,000,000 or something. If And you think about the world from a certain set of constraints, that was true. But it turns out that the market of people that want to move around cities easily grows quickly when you have a better product. So thinking about the growth rate of the market, not just the growth rate of the startup, super important if you're going to identify something really big. And a related concept to that is the biggest companies that we have been able to be a part of and I think the biggest companies in the technology industry as a whole happen when there's a technological platform shift. So for example, stick with the iPhone example, the iPhone app store launches in 2008. In a period of say 2009 to 2012, Uber's a good example but there's other ones like Snapchat which really just didn't quite make sense before mobile phones and apps. And so trying to identify these platform shifts, Most people are wrong about this, so you have to learn to trust your own intuitions here. It's very hard to differentiate between real trends and fake trends. The sometimes you can. The metric that I use to differentiate between a real trend and a fake trend is similar to loving a product. It's when is there a new platform that people are using many hours every day. that might be a good time to start a VR company. And here's why that's important. The hardest thing to get, especially right now in Silicon Valley, is critical mass of talented people at one company. It's easy to get the first few employees, you can give them a ton of equity, give them big job titles, but that stops to work. And then you get to employee 30, employee 300. One was a company I started a long time ago that did social networking on iPhones and another was OpenAI. if we don't do a good job or if someone does not do a good job building AGI, the world will very likely get destroyed and we need you specifically to do this piece of it, and if you don't do that it's really bad for the world. And that is a really hard pitch to say no to. And so a startup that has a reason why people need to join it is super powerful. The sixth one is is thinking about how impressed you are by the founders and the early employees at the startup. So as a general observation, it is extremely powerful whenever you can identify something in the world that is true and important and that most people don't believe. And in fact, I think this is one of the two major market inefficiencies that startups get to exploit. And they are like hundreds of times more effective than people that aren't like this. And, you know, there are programmers that are I I know people hate the 10x engineer meme because it's so often used to justify being a jerk, but there are plenty of people who are 10 times as good as average programmers and also nice people. And in companies where you find a lot of these people concentrated in the early hires, this is a huge deal. And these startups consistently outperform. And the quality of the early people at a company, the quality of the founders is so determinant of success and it has such a bigger impact than people like to believe or wanna believe about the world that when you find this, it is one of these secrets about the world that is critically important and that people try not to believe. So I think that's a really great thing to look for. The other big market inefficiency to look for is ideas that sound bad but are good. So most ideas that sound bad are unfortunately bad and you should try not to join those companies. sound bad but are good. If an idea is good and sounds good, then the big companies will try to do it and usually outcompete you. But there's a really important difference between startups and big companies. If you have the same idea at a big company and you wanna do it, you have to get your boss to say yes, your boss's boss to say yes, your boss's boss to say yes, and then Sundar to say yes, and then Larry Page to say yes. no kills the entire idea. And if the idea sounds bad, someone will, rationally so, say no. If you're a start up, you may also have 20 conversations, you may go up and down Sand Hill Road trying to give it someone to fund it, but you only need one yes. So one idea I often ask startups is can you tell me why this idea sounds bad to the big companies but actually is good? And then a final thing that I look at are what, this has been a long standing YC metric. What are the smartest sort of recent college graduates excited about? In our experience now over more than you know, thirteen years that YC has been in business, that group of people consistently is three, four years ahead of what investors focus on. And that has been a model for us of identifying real trends before they happen. That group is not always right. There have been some big failures, but directionally speaking young people I think have And you have to choose the peers whose opinion you care about in your life very, very carefully. Most people will have bring whatever biases they have about what a career should look like or what a safe choice is or what a good thing to work on is. They'll they'll bring all that to the table. And most people have let bad processes in behind their firewall and they will give you bad advice. And so trying to find a group of people that you can go to in your lives whenever you have a big career decision that are kind of open minded and intellectually rigorous thinkers and who care about the similar kinds of things that you care about, whatever that is, is a really valuable thing to do. I was lucky to find a handful of those people very early in my life. I still ping them on every big decision. And the advice that they give me, I think, is generally quite good and very different than what I'd get from most of my friends. So finding people who can give you good advice about what startup to join is really important. I was gonna talk about how to think about equity at a startup, but I only have one minute left. So I will say this, you probably aren't getting enough. I think most startups are not nearly generous enough with employee equity. The difference, the amount of value that you create as an early employee versus a founder is not the 100x difference that you usually see reflected on a cap table. We try to get YC startups to be more generous with equity and I think over time it's trending in that direction. But remember, startups need really talented people. Startups need people that could otherwise go work at Google and make a gigantic salary. And I think you should demand to be treated fairly for that.
