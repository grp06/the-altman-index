Unknown: Let's talk about that Microsoft deal for a second, because you took a billion dollars from Microsoft.
Sam Altman: Yeah. If Microsoft can collaborate with us and we can build, like, an amazing supercomputer to train these models on, That clearly benefits us. We really need that, and Microsoft's a great partner to build it. But that should eventually benefit all Azure customers with what they learn from it. particular supercomputers that work for our workloads. Mhmm. I think what's particularly good about Microsoft is the degree to which they're mission aligned with us. It's hard to find a partner that can, you know, really scale with us on the capital side over the coming years, have the capability to build the computing infrastructure we need, and have a super aligned
Unknown: how important that mission alignment is for investors. Like, as we said at the beginning, we have a very atypical structure. We have a very atypical mission. The idea that we might actually need to serve the world over serving investors,
Unknown: it's all still, you know, within the not the AGI realm. How does this work get you there? Yeah. So
Unknown: the way to think about the way that we think about progress, right, think the way that in science you normally think about your progress is about ideas. Right? That you're really building up this ladder of, okay, I came up with this theory that explains these phenomena and simplifies everything, and now I can make the next theory. And eventually, you get to whatever applications you want. The way that we think about AI, I think we take much more of almost a startup mindset to it, is to think about capability. We think of it as, can we solve this super hard challenge? And in doing so, we think we'll generate these general purpose methods that can be reused elsewhere. And so, for example, we built a system that beat the world champions at the complex video game DOTA two. We actually took that exact same training system, pointed it at robotics to solve this robotic hand problem that no one had to be able to solve. And so I think the way that I think about it is, yeah, for sure, everything we generate still has limitations.
