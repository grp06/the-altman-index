Sam Altman: unlike most companies trying to build artificial intelligence, where people take basically deep learning and apply it to narrow ideas, and it works sometimes astonishingly well, usually at least pretty well, We are trying to build one intelligence that is smarter and more capable than humans in every way. We're trying to use this to solve the biggest problems facing the world. We're trying to use this I think we will enable because we'll have such powerful artificial intelligence. And someday, I think we will sort of build the descendants of humanity and launch them off to colonize the universe. where the value we create, a large part of it gets shared with the world. This is just such a fundamental technology that we have to design a new corporate structure so that our investors can make a great return and our employees too, but also that we figure out a way that the whole world wins. I think this is different. If we're successful in this quest, and it's very hard, but if we're successful, I think it will be the most significant technological transformation in human history. I think it will eclipse the agriculture revolution, the industrial revolution, the internet revolution all put together.
