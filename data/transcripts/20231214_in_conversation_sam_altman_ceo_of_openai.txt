Sam Altman: how the AI future is gonna unfold now than I did even a year ago and certainly five years ago, but watching what the world is doing with ChatGPT, the way people are using these new tools to architect the future, you know, get better advice. The But seeing how people are using it to level up themselves, It seems pretty great. Obviously, there'll be difficult challenges we'll have to navigate, but I I really do believe that if you put great tools in people's hands, they will build amazing things for all of us. And the speed with which that's happening, since we've released ChatGPT and other people have released great products too, that's been pretty exciting. And what it means if everybody on earth can get better health care than the best than the sort of, like, richest, most privileged kid today. Like, we can't even imagine what that's gonna be like. Curing cancer, And I I think you can see the glimpses of that now with the way students are learning with ChatGPT, primitive and, you know, marvel though it is. So, what it means to put this in everybody's pocket if everybody gets this, like, super helpful assistant that can do anything they need. How quickly we can go from having our minds blown to saying, like, yeah, of course, like, what do you mean my phone didn't used to be smart? Right. I like, they're gonna I remember seeing a photo like a like a video once of like a this is like right after iPhones came out of a baby that had was, you know, parents put a magazine in front of her and she was going like this because the idea that she couldn't like pinch to zoom on a device was just like, it didn't make sense. And to everybody else at the time, they were like, how did this happen so fast? And now in a few years, like, kids who are just growing up, they will never have known a time where computers couldn't understand, where AI was not a thing. And we're all just gonna get used to this right away, and it'll blow our minds for a little bit of time. CHA2PT blew the world's mind for two weeks, that may happen, and I think it's worth being very honest about. I think though it'll happen differently than we think. I I think, like, I I was very afraid for a while that the way this was gonna work was, like, AI just started doing every job, you know, and it went from the grocery store checkout clerks to sort of like doctors to just everything was went went went went. But but what seems to be happening, what I think will happen more than I originally thought is this will be a tool that people, in many cases, it will totally change some jobs, but in many cases, this is something that will just change the way people do their jobs in the same way that mobile phones did, the Internet before that, computers before that. We adapt and we find new better ways to work, and that's sort of like, that is the rollout of progress, like, that's been going on for a super long time with one technology revolution after another. Now, you're never supposed to say this time is different, but it does feel to me that this time is different. Yeah. And it's a little scary for sure. Yeah. But I think human ingenuity, creativity, desire to be useful to each other, to like play silly status games, whatever you wanna call it, that is so strong, we are so good, we are so creative, we will find new things to do. Most of our jobs today just weren't jobs that existed five hundred years ago in any way. And the future is gonna be like that too. Our kids and grandkids and great grandkids, they're gonna do different things. And again, I think that's okay. We've just gotta figure out how we're gonna manage through this rapid change. I think that the speed of this, as you said earlier, will be different than any previous technological revolution. And I think more than any other technology I can point to a historical example for, this technology either has the ability to do the most ever to concentrate wealth and power, which would be really bad, or the most to broadly distribute and enable people to do it. And I think if you look at the trajectory AI is on right now, it's much more to that latter camp, and and it's gonna be incredible. It's gonna lift the world up. It it really is something that, like, everyone's just got a new tool in their pocket, and they're doing these amazing things with it, and that is how I think you get real significant lasting change. But you can imagine all these worlds with AI where it wouldn't be like that, and it would be this sort of, like, centralizing force that one company or some small group of companies get to use. You know, like, that sticks. That there's something about that that really resonates with us. I don't know like how many when OpenAI first started, every article about us used the same Terminator photo until maybe 2018 was the first version. We didn't really believe in it until longer than that. Originally, we were working on, like, agents that could play video games with the thinking that as they got smarter and smarter, they could, you know, work in more complex environments. when we started OpenAI, we worried about that a lot and we still do. I mean, I think if the technology goes wrong, it could be quite scary which is why we work so hard on safety, but we also believe that you cannot build this safely in a vacuum. If you just build this in a lab and if we don't get contact with reality, the system will have all of these problems and bugs, there'll be biases in there that we don't understand, that'll work in these ways we didn't intend, it won't serve what people want. So we believe that you gotta deploy. Tell us what's broken. Tell us where it's not meeting your needs. Tell us where it's really screwing up badly. And that tight feedback loop, I think is the only way I know how to develop let let technology and society co evolve together and really listen to what people actually want. One thing we say a lot is that the people that are gonna be most affected by technology deserve the biggest voice in you just can't do that. one, there's a lot of talk about this, but like people using these systems to create bioweapons, which hopefully people just won't do, but I do think the systems will be capable of, and another is on I think we feel the weight of what we're doing. And I have watched it change people who come in to work on AI in all sorts of ways. And you're like, oh, you know, it's another tech job. Starting for all of us is another job in some degree or other. But we you feel the responsibility of it. We feel like we're like living through moving history. And I think that, like, everybody wants to get that right. So We I I to the degree that we have done things well, and we certainly have not done everything well, but we really try to listen to as broad of a base of stakeholders as we can. But one thing that we try to do differently than what other AI companies have done or other tech companies have done is we really try to get out in the world and listen. you know, we And then almost exactly a year ago, a year and ten days, I guess, we launched ChatGPT to the world. we've then, like, jumped into this tornado that has not stopped and everybody's life at the company. Like, the way I say it is we had to go through what what most companies get to do over five or ten years, most tech companies in a six month period. And so all these things I wanted to do were just like there were not enough hours in the day or days in the year, whatever you wanna call and those were super meaningful. I I think over over the next year, I think these systems are gonna start to get significantly more capable, which will be great in a lot of ways, but also makes the stakes higher. And so the time that we've gotten to to sort of get the feedback from people, from our leaders, from institutions, from communities about how to develop this, that's been super important. like being in the news and reading these things that just don't seem like me at all, but I I do,
Unknown: In response to that, I would rather deflect the light from me to the fierceness of this moment we're in right now. Yep. And I congratulate you on putting together and coordinating a meeting that that wakes us up that wakes us up to a paradigm shift that is unlike anything that I have ever seen in my lifetime with real estate, with job placement, with economic empowerment. It it it is not a war against colors and kinds. Our jobs are being taken over by machines. because the truth of the matter is the projection for black wealth in particular by 2050 is projected to be at zero. COVID is probably gonna speed that up in my view that probably by 2030, we're gonna see the absence of middle class because technology is gonna speed up a lot of things that we need, health care, operations, detecting disease, developing systems and patterns for transportation, for growth, for the possibilities are absolutely endless. The the the great side is, as Sam was talking about, our children are gonna grow up with something that is natural to them that is not natural to us. That's great. But for those that are 40 and above or 30 and above, how do we adapt and survive in the middle of a transforming society that's being transformed in a way that we have never seen it transformed before? Okay? I lived through the transformation from the industrial age to the information age. I've watched all the Midwest shut down, the plants close, people lose their jobs and have to rediscover themselves. What are we gonna do in the meantime? Yeah. And so that's a real issue. We've seen this before. We've seen it from the agricultural age to the industrial age. Historically, we've seen it periodically as you talked about. The reason I think that entrepreneurship is important is in part because those people who are gonna find themselves without jobs. Incidentally, when you start talking about tech corporations, it's not just the obvious tech corporations like the one that just walked off the stage. Every corporation, whether you're talking about Amazon, because we need trumpets to blow everywhere where we begin to think seriously about how do we take innovation and turn it in a way that while our children will grow up organically and hopefully not just consume technology, but create technology? See, hopefully hopefully hopefully, if we are lucky this time, we won't be the consumers only. Historically, we don't create. We have to change that if we're going to be effective in the society to come. In the meantime, for those of us who are older, and I don't mean as old as me, but even much younger than me, the question arises as these jobs begin to dissipate, how will we eat in the midst of inflation? And the question has to come back as affirmative action is dismissed as ESG is being sued around the country for environmental, social impact and governance in corporations that are being attacked for trying to bring about equity in the in the workspace, nobody's job is safe. So we need to think that if you're not engineering, if you're not creating, and you're just consuming, you're in real trouble, and there's no guarantee that your education you made that with your student loan. If you don't learn to think differently and create meaningful, sustainable forces of income, and that's why entrepreneurship is that the substratum of what we're doing at Good Soil I'm not talking about what I'm doing at the Potter's House. I'm talking about what I'm doing through TDGX Enterprises That's right. And aggregation of entrepreneurs, that will stop the percentage, the largest percentage of African American owned businesses in this country, about 90 some 90 plus percent have less than two employees. That's right. Because we don't think in terms of scaling up our business. We just think in terms of paying the rent and paying the bills. Right. As that wouldn't be so bad the entrance of technology and AI and the dismissing of more and more jobs who we could employ because the largest part of Americans work for small businesses, not major corporations. That's right. So when you start thinking about that the future depends on us radically scaling up entrepreneurship That's right. Our focus with Good Soil and the development of it is more than just legacy and just another thing T. V. Jake's decided to do. I am trying to stop the tidal wave of poverty that is headed for our cities if we don't move immediately. it's access to housing, It's it's access to some place to sleep, to stay, to garner information, to develop yourself, to be improve yourself is part of our responsibility as human beings one to another. And it is certainly more prevalent amongst black people, but not black people alone. This when this thing shifts like it's going to shift, it's going to affect all people. And, yes, there will be people who organically adapt and find jobs in those positions. We have to reorganize the way we educate people. We have to reorganize the way we think about things. But for entrepreneurs, we have to begin to think not only about how we can hire people, but how we can take technology to increase our profit margins so that we can scale our businesses, so that we can access information. Sometimes we're taking courses and classes through not just getting degrees and and and letters, but taking courses and classes that keep us on the cutting edge. It's that we are busy for the sake of being busy, but we're not doing business. and business are two different things. Talk to me. And and we have to we have to Come on, preach. Inject into the culture of how we think a different way of how we think, how we parent, what we talk about around the table, building wealth in your sleep. So mentality has a lot to do So is he. And and I'm not sure that we are thinking right, and I applaud you, sir, for having the courage to to take on the challenge of bringing up the kinds of discussions that wake us up out of our sleep. The you're absolutely right. The one thing I would say just a tiny bit differently is it's not black, it's not white, it's not brown. The new color is green. But the truth of the matter is economics is moving away from paper, Bonnie. Yep. You know? Yeah. And we have to begin to think even beyond we have a color coded society, Good Good Soil has an app. Right. We have we we created the Good Soil app so that we could aggregate without being limited by distance or zip codes in terms of being to aggregate like minded people who were entrepreneurs who had the courage to go higher. It takes courage to go higher. It takes courage to admit what you don't know. It takes courage to change the old ways that your father's taught you. It takes courage to implement new ideologies that embrace the innovation of the fierce urgency of now. And if we don't develop that courage and that does not mean courage is not the absence of fear. Courage is not the absence of fear. Courage is the ability to override the fear and feel the fear and do it anyway, and to launch out where others have not gone. Not so that we can ride around in Porsches, but so that we can send our children to the kinds of schools that prepare them for the future and train them for the opportunities. And we are not vying for the handouts because there are not enough handouts as there are hands We need courses. So in our app, we are walking entrepreneurs step by step into how to impact, grow, and scale their businesses to increase impact. And by the way, in June, shameless plug, we're going to be meeting in Dallas. You can find it up under Good Soil movement. You we're gonna be meeting in June just to talk to entrepreneurs because not that of all, black women are leaving corporate America like it was on fire. Okay. Number one group starting businesses, black women. Black women are starting business more readily than other people group. Access to capital is one of their biggest problem, and the good soil the whole point of good soil is to connect talent with opportunity, with access for future development. And we're trying to bridge that gap skillfully and artfully in such a way. No. We're not gonna be able to get old people to go back and use GPT necessarily, but we might get some of them. But the reality is if we don't start hiring ourselves, I believe that we are the people we have been waiting on. And And so the app is a place not only for networking and aggregating and and not only for advertising, but also for access to information. Maybe you don't need to hire somebody immediately or the person you hire can can increase efficiency with AI and technology. I know that's something you're getting ready to take up. If you can do it with technology, you don't have to pay health insurance, you don't have to pay life insurance, you don't have to pay FICA taxes, you don't have to pay for space. The reason that the big companies are moving into technology is because they don't get sick, they don't take off, they don't take vacation, they're not on PTO, they don't take two hour lunch breaks, They're not over in the corner playing with porn. They're doing whatever Yeah. I shot you, didn't I? Yeah. exactly what they're supposed to be doing. So one of our problems is we don't have great accounting system, which you can't talk to banks without accounting. That's right. Technology is gonna bring within our reach a greater ability to develop the kinds of accounting systems so that we are eligible for the opportunities that proceed us. What we are doing through Good Soil is to create a climate of like minded people. One of the hardest things to do, you I can't do it in church because some people in church have their mindset, some people don't. Some people are just waiting for the bus to take them to heaven. Some people are are, you know you know, there's the you you church is an amalgamation of all kinds of people. But when you get everybody in one place with one accord who want the same thing, but in a room like this, for every need in this room, there's somebody there's an answer in this room sitting at the table right across from you. Talk to me. You you understand? And if you are privileged enough to be in an environment of people who are like minded, you don't have to waste time arguing about where we're going. We can focus on how we're gonna get there. That's right. And so you can do things that you couldn't do before, and people with low budgets can do graphic arts designs to technology. You can communicate with your customers better. You can draft a letter that keeps connection with them because everything about business is predicated on relationship. then you have lost resources. And we have raised a generation of people who are in the prime of their life right now who were raised playing with machines and not people they don't understand relationships That's right. And the power that relationships bring. I was talking to somebody behind stage. The power that you use to bring this last session, Sam Altman here, everybody can't bring Sam Altman on this day. Everybody can't do that. That's relationship. And so we become the beneficiaries of your relationships. You are no stronger than the people you relate to Come on. And you have no more clients and how you relate to them, and and technology enables you to maintain that relationship at a at a modicum of the price that it used to cost. The a modicum of the price to produce a film and put it on Netflix versus put it on the big screen. Everything's going down to be able to stream music as opposed to an eight track or a record player or a cassette player or or or m p three or whatever. Everything's moving so fast, and we're we're getting it and we're consuming it. We're we're we're loving it. We're enjoying it. We're just not making it. Come on. There is no way you can profit consuming. I'm gonna go bishop Jinx. The very first thing God commanded man to do was to be fruitful. Be fruitful. He didn't command him to eat. He commanded him to be fruitful. Reason being, you can't be fruitful if you're not seedful. In this room, the reason we call it good soil, because in this room, there are seeds of greatness in every person in this room. If they have the courage to cultivate that seed, if they have the ability to fertilize it with the opportunity of being in a influential atmosphere where you can get away from the people who are trying to crab barrel you back down. Then it becomes possible for you to fly with the eagles rather than to swim with the ducks. That's it. And and so you have to decide right now. It takes courage to fly with the eagles. It takes courage to get into the wind. And yes, there's storms up there and there's fluctuations and this the the velocity of the wind is overwhelming sometimes, but the ego uses the storm to its advantage. Some of our current richest families got rich during the the depression. Are we going to use it to be wind beneath our wings? Or are we gonna just yell at it and complain about it and cry about it and roll over and give up about it? How are we gonna talk around the dinner table? I know dinner table's out of style, but We need to bring it back. We need to bring it back. Because if you don't if you're not talking to your children about resources Somebody else about finances, if you're not talking to them about future, if you're not talking to them about ownership and stewardship, if if if you stop giving them money and make them earn money and do like my mother did, my mother gave me a savings account for Christmas when I was seven. That's right. A passbook savings account took me downtown. Yes, And took took me to work. My father demanded that I work and you take your hands out your pocket and have a good work ethic because if you're gonna be a great entrepreneur, let me announce to you, you do not become an entrepreneur because you don't wanna work for anybody. The truth of the matter is if you're an entrepreneur, you're working so you can make the payroll, you're working so you can make keep the building, you're working so that you can satisfy the client, you're just working for somebody else in a different way and you are working past 05:00. if you work on the front end, you can rest on the back end. If you don't work on the front end, there'll be no rest on the back end, and there's nothing worse than getting old and being broke. Woah. There is no guarantee. You might be pleasantly surprised, but there is no guarantee that they will be able to take care of you. There is no guarantee that they can have enough PTO to take care of you. There is no guarantee that they will be employed this is a clarion call for us to start thinking because everything that we're seeing, those robots know it, that didn't start last year. That's right. That's been creeping up behind us while we were dropping it like it's hot and and and and and and while we were lying dancing at weddings and while we were having a good time and and and and and cooking pork chops and doing what we do and and and and shrimp and grits and all that, while we were making shrimp and grits, And I love shrimp and grits. I'm not throwing off against anybody. Y'all know I cook. This is what I'm saying. This this moment, this important way of reaching people, communicating with people through technology opens up doors of access that levels the playing floor. When I got on television as a minister, we we had still do have to pay for airtime. Okay? And it was very expensive to pay for airtime. We got the beatings for raising the money, but we didn't get the money that we raised. What people didn't know, you had to pay for the airtime, you had to pay for the cameraman, you had to pay for the editing, you had to pay for everything. And and the studios, whoever produced you, they charged us for their airtime. Okay? You can stream from a storefront. Look at how the playing field is leveled by technology. If you you have a big message and a phone, you can get your message out without having to pay anybody for anything at any time in any way because the technology look look at how technology is leveling the playing floor that we might have a greater opportunity to reach masses of people, not just here in America. The conversations that we're having here in Atlanta, they were having at the g eight summit. Technology is not an American thing. It is a global takeover. The the countries are deciding which country is gonna focus on what aspect of technology. So it's not just legislated by congress and what they've gotta say. It will be years before our laws catch up with our technology. That's right. We don't have laws that's regulating the World Wide Web. We're we're we're still your voice print, your your facial recognition, your your content, all needs to be copywritten, needs to be controlled because technology I got on AI and asked it to write out a sermon that sounded like TD Jakes. now you got one in your phone. For free. For free. Look at how the playing field is changing. Are you thinking about how to take your We were talking about vision boards. You you you do you have a vision to grow? If you have a vision to grow I'm not even talking about capital because if I give capital to a person who has no vision, they'll spend it. That's right. Meet me in June at Good Soil in Dallas, Texas, register today. I have a lot to say. I'm serious. I have a lot to say. I believe that God left me in the earth to talk to you about what your vision is for the future, and I've amassed a lot of experts to continue. We had house parties. The party's in Atlanta,
