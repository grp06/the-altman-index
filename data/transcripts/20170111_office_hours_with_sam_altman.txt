Unknown: Alright. So this is going to be the first office hours we're doing on YouTube and people have submitted questions on h n. So we're I am ready. And so, yeah. Alright. This is Sam Altman. this is kind of a couple questions put together. As a b to b company,
Sam Altman: universal challenge that b two b companies face. The answer tends to be very different for different sorts of companies. There are some companies where all your customers go to one trade show, and the answer is to go there and and meet a bunch of them. There are others where you may only have 10 potential customers in the world, and the answer is to just start figuring out any way to get in front of them, cold emails, referrals, whatever. But I think there is an implied premise in there, which is that you need to get to companies outside of your network. Mhmm. That's one way of addressing the problem. The other is to expand your network and get companies into it. And I think that is the approach I have seen work better. So I would think about expanding your network. The particular example of YC, most we we have kind of built the YC community in such a way that most people that are b two b companies get their first 20 customers from other y c companies. And this has been super valuable Yeah. For y c and for b two b companies doing y c. And we now have enough companies and enough different verticals you can usually find them. If you're not in YC, I still think you wanna think about things in a similar way, which is how can I meet other entrepreneurs who are always founder to founder sales tend to work pretty well, or how can I just
Unknown: get a bigger network and get access to a broader group of people where I can find my first customers? So in terms of doing that, do you advise people to go to meetups and stuff like that? I think
Sam Altman: one thing that a lot of people, including myself, did when they were founders that worked pretty well was just start emailing other founders that you respect that are in your same city and suggest getting together. And, you know, like, So, I think this is like a strategy that works to expand a network. It's harder if you are not in some sort of startup hub Mhmm. Because it is easier to establish these relationships in person. one of the things that is magic about Silicon Valley is that there's this strong culture of helping other people, and and and and startups are the dominant I And that is how, I think, many people end up building their networks. There are some conferences and meetups that are really good. And although I'm, like, sort of shy in big groups and I don't like them myself, I know some people really do. Yeah. But most of them are filled with people that I just I don't think are very good. Another thing that people forget is if you build something impressive, this was a little bit less true when the network was
Unknown: Alright. So the next question is, when founding a startup, is being a college student an advantage or a disadvantage? Does it matter at all? I
Sam Altman: I'll answer it normally You generally are fairly rootless and can pick up and move around the world the way I lived during my startup where I had rats running through my kitchen the the ability to live cheaply is a huge advantage over startups The biggest advantage of all, I think, is that not always, but frequently, young people tend to be on the forefront of new technological shifts. Mhmm. And so you better than chance. in business. You're probably of any YC partners that didn't go where I went. Yeah. No. You you you have to be able to convince really good technical people to follow you. So if you're not going to be technical, And you have to have a very strong idea and then sweat all the details. And Well, And there's many free ways now online,
Unknown: Alright. So why do you think crowdfunding for startups hasn't kicked off as well as hoped, I guess, as hoped by whoever was starting it?
Sam Altman: The thing that I still see going most wrong with crowdfunding for startups is it's easy if you're a startup that doesn't need it because you already have very well known investors. But thus far, when it comes to equity crowdfunding, the crowd has been less willing to back things that don't have professional investor support. Mhmm. And so it has become largely, though not exclusively, a way for believe that crowdfunding should be important, but clearly, have not yet and and I and I don't blame people for not doing it because, certainly, as an investor, I want to get to know the company in person, the founders well in person. And I probably would not go investing in people I've never met via a crowdfunding platform. So I think we still have some iteration to do on the model. Okay. Cool.
Unknown: slash maximize potential impact on the world for a high school student developer? Elon Musk named a few things he thinks would be world changing in ten to twenty years. What do you think high school students should be working on right now?
Sam Altman: AI and computer security. In fact, I still stand by within computer science that those are two really good areas to pursue. It's amazing to me how much AI has changed since I was an undergrad, mostly in good ways. I had stayed at school longer, I would have studied what was at the time called biotechnology and now it's called sometimes that, sometimes synthetic biology, but that sort of stuff, where you're really kind of pushing the edge of what computers and biology can do together and how we can So I'm I'm the chairman of the board of two nuclear energy companies, and I I really believe that quality of life and cost of energy are super correlated. I also believe we'll destroy the planet if we can't get cheap, clean energy. I was in Beijing recently, and I could not believe the pollution. clean energy, really cheap clean energy would be transformational. I mean, education is is really big and underexplored. it's still early, but VR, AR I tried to read one book in every topic. I tried to make smart friends that were working on really different things. And then I tried a bunch of things. So, I kind of converged at what I do now. you know, breadth first and then increasingly depth first And I ended up getting super specific in a few areas. The the importance of the cost of energy is super obvious. Yeah. There's a lot of things, and it doesn't take brilliance to see them. Although, are some things that the world needs that are are very non obvious. It doesn't go the other way. If you identify something the world needs, they probably need it. If you identify something obvious the world needs, they probably need it. We probably need it. In terms of values, the world does not need or value the
Unknown: Okay. So back to VRAR. With VRAR on the rise in the last couple of years, how do you think it's going to impact the startup community? And in your opinion, what industry is going to get impacted the most in the next ten to twenty years? Well, I think,
Sam Altman: they're really transformational companies. Get formed in clusters on the rise of a new platform. So in, you know, 1996 through 2000, we had the birth of the Internet Mhmm. Or say the rise of the Internet. And as part of that, we had the rise of all these companies. Yep. And then it was kind of quiet for a while. And then after the iPhone in 2007, maybe from 2007 to 2011, we had another rise of the mobile first companies. And I would Facebook somewhat split the difference. I'd mostly throw them into the mobile bucket in terms of where they got really huge. a handful of 100,000,000,000 plus companies. but I can suggest a metric for how you should know when it's time to start really focusing. And that is you wanna look at usage per individual user. Mhmm. So before the iPhone, but people didn't use them all day, every day like they do with an iPhone. They buy them. They use them a couple times, they didn't even take them with them every day. They certainly didn't do much besides calling on them in calendar, maybe. And then the iPhone came out. And the iPhone didn't sell that many in its first year relative to how many phones Nokia sold or whatever in 2000 so I would ignore total shipments for VR and AR and I would wait until it gets to the point where someone builds a device or software that once people get it, they use it a lot of every day. Mhmm.
Unknown: Similar to a question before,
Sam Altman: Later,
Unknown: Alright. So, going into one of the more obscure questions. Sam, if you were an important but not founder employee at a start up and you your company were to be acquired, how would you approach the process of integrating and ensuring success between the companies? And how would you evaluate the acquiring company and decide if it's worth staying?
Sam Altman: Most acquisitions are not smooth sailing, first of all. So I would go into it expect knowing that it's going to be hard. The most important thing that I have seen is an agreement before the acquisition is finalized about autonomy of the target company. And so I would push the founders to make sure that you got such an agreement, that you would operate as independently as possible. the level of independence upfront. Mhmm. Piece of advice number two, as a important leader in the company, make it your personal business to develop strong relationships with as many people as you can at the acquiring company,
Unknown: and then be a bridge as tensions inevitably rise. Mhmm. And any opinion on how long a person like that should stay?
Sam Altman: I would give it, like, a good six to nine months before making a decision that it's not gonna work. Okay. Cool.
