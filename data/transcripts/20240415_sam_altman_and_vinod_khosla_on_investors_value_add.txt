Unknown: 90% of investors add no value. In my assessment, 70% of investors add negative value to a company. That means they're advising a company. This is part of team building too for, for entrepreneurs. They're advising a company when they haven't earned the right to advise an entrepreneur. Just because you got an MBA and joined a venture firm doesn't mean you're qualified to advise an entrepreneur. Biggest piece of it, not the only way, is have you built a large company? Have you gone through how hard it is, how uncertain it is, how traumatic it is to go through?
