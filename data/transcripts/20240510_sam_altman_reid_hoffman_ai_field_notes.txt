Unknown: you and the whole team's perspectives on various things and AI kind of led me to do this. And so I coincident it with the release of GBD4 because we didn't want to pre show the game. And it's a little bit of the AI is amplification intelligence or augmentation intelligence versus artificial intelligence or an moment, amplifying human ability. one part of it was a huge issue across all professions thing that solving the blank page problem. You're writing a product resource document, marketing copy, legal brief term sheet, medical analysis, commencement speech. You you go, okay, go into a prompt type something and it generates something. Well, maybe g b four would say something interesting about it, especially when mixed with something else. Like you say, you just read something about Chomsky and linguistics or something else. And it gives you something interesting
Sam Altman: Yeah. One of the things that's been most gratifying to see is the success people have had using this as a creative tool to get past that blank page problem, to get unstuck on something, to generate a bunch of new ideas. a replacement for creative work in any way. But as a new arrow in the quiver, I think it's people have had surprising success in many different ways, and it's been it's been very fun to watch the breadth of human creativity in finding out what to do with this. One of the things that I hear a lot is parents of small kids talking about how every night their kids just wanna make up stories with g p t four. And there seems to be, like, unending appetite for this from some kids. And at least, like, you know, hearing parents report back, some children are able to far outweigh what some adults are able to do with coming up with really creative stories and and just being fluent quickly with a new way to use this this technology. So that's been interesting.
Unknown: And you're like, okay. Right? And I know even with GBD three, let alone GBD four, people have written children's stories illustrating sometimes through DALL E and have published those. So while mine, by navigation and timing, maybe the first co authorship with GBD four, there were already books being published with GBD three, with DALL E and so forth. You know, so we get the kids. We've always haven't had a
Sam Altman: I totally get why this technology is causing a lot of change and some problems for extremely overworked teachers. That's all very natural. The adaptation's gonna take some time. But on the upside, I think what's happening is remarkable and exciting. translation, summarization. There's, you know, information access. I've come to rely on it for many categories. But I think the deepest thing that I have found so far with it is the ability to learn new things better than Wikipedia, you know, leading way of learning something new fast. And I and many other people love the style of sort of interactive chat with a sort of AI tutor light to learn something new. And
Unknown: I use GBD4. I generate eight essays. I hand those essays out. This high school, probably maybe college. And I say, this is a D plus do better.
Sam Altman: Yeah. I think there's probably some concerns with using these systems for grading, but I I also think we'll find ways to make it okay and and work in in many ways. And Certainly an exciting world to get to through this lens of human amplification. The idea that we can have doctors that can provide a higher quality of care and care to many more people using these tools to automate parts of it but keep humans in the loop. There's a lot of companies now working in that direction. I think it's rightfully gonna be a long time before most people want a full on AI doctor. On the education front, it's obviously gonna get so much better, but we're sort of already there. People are now used to their phones being able to tutor them on things that they need, which which is which is amazing. One of the most fun parts of the job is getting to meet with developers and hear about what they're already doing and what they're planning to do. And, certainly, medical advice and tutoring are frequent and extremely exciting areas.
Unknown: Did you have any reflections on the impromptu book, things that I should have worked more on or
Sam Altman: the same way that other people respond to it. But I thought it was great. I think it raises a lot of issues. I it was this weird sort of, like, so close to for so long. all of the problems, all of the kind of limitations. And you did a great job of still highlighting those and, you know, to some embarrassment in some cases. But but it was a very strange experience,
Unknown: What are you currently thinking about what this amplification means for the next ten years ish, five years ish? Because all this the impacts on work will take time on what's going on, and how should people think about amplification as a path for themselves and a path for their companies?
Sam Altman: there was a huge overhang of the amount of output the world wanted. And if people are way more effective, they're just doing way more. We've seen this first with where you give people better tools and they just do more stuff, better stuff. And amplifying your ability cost premium on work that has to be split across two people. There's the communication overhead. There's the the miscommunication. There's everything else. And if you can make one person twice as productive, you don't do as much as two people could do. Maybe you do as much as three and a half or four people could do in for many kinds of tasks. And I think one of the things that we are seeing with this g p d four application is is that. One of the areas that we most need to figure out is how to get these models to be super reliable while not losing the creativity that people like or, you know, giving settings for when you want one or the other. We don't have the answer here yet. We have a bunch of ideas, and we're able to make week over week improvement in the problem. But, you know, telling you when we're gonna be able to really get to a system that is accurate to what you as the user want. I carefully use that instead of saying a system that is true because that's really hard.
Unknown: I mean, one of the things that's contained in your answer, I think, really important is the dynamics of learning. So, like, if you said, well, we have an agreement about what a Well, you know, easy enough to take to train an agent like that, put it in the browser, And then, of the, hey, I'm like this thing. You hear the earth is actually flat or the moon And is made out of blue
Sam Altman: how hard this problem is. Maybe I just heard it repeated by people so often. I now believe it's true. But I think that there was a time where some of the social media platforms were banning people for saying that COVID may have leaked from a lab and that, you know, you can't say that. It's it's xenophobic. It's racist. It's hateful. It's it's inaccurate. It's it's fake news, whatever. And I think people were just having, like, posts about that deleted. And then all of a sudden, the kind of elite opinion on that changed. I remember there was one article that came out that seemed to really change it, and and and, like, you know, you see this big backtrack there. But but you literally weren't able to discuss it in in in, like, the channels that are the de facto important channels now. And that's the kind of thing where if you let someone dictate truth, the earth is not flat. The Holocaust did happen. I think we can make a system where we're willing to make editorial calls on those two. where a user can say a lot more about how they want the model to behave in different ways. And so if you want a high degree of careful calibration, the model can do that. And if you want something else, the model can do that too. And, you know, if you want the model in a very creative mode I think people are finding more and more, it doesn't quite work. Things they think they want a model to do or not do or never do doesn't always apply. And it's uncomfortable, but giving the user a lot more control is is something we think is important. And, you know, if you want that story about the astronaut going to the moon and being sure it was made out of blue cheese, in some context, that's totally fine. But it's telling you something that is, like, clearly not a fact in some other sense. There was this astronaut who talked to reporter a reporter years, decades after going to the moon. And they kinda asked him what it was like. And he said, you know, I kinda forget about it. And then sometimes I'm out at my backyard at night looking at how beautiful the moon is, and I just remembered, like, oh, man. All these years ago, I went there and walked around on it, an amazing story. But I also think when we kind of look back at this age of creating the first AI systems,
Unknown: The basically, the last chapter in the impromptu book was my very strongly held belief, but also argument is that we across video conferencing, you know, all of this stuff. There's a number of of major scale problems facing the world. Climate change, economic transformation, and elevation of humanity, people adapting to the new world, whether it's education skills, etcetera, you know, having fairness across the society. Are there any that you think that AI is not a particularly good fit for? And then after that, what's a surprisingly good fit where people just had probably hadn't occurred to them?
Sam Altman: So I think technology is the fundamental ingredient in making the world better in all of these ways. But technology on its own doesn't always, doesn't usually do it. You need society. You need the participation of people. You need the kinda contributions of all of our institutions and what has made this, you know, from the enlightenment until now era so impressive coming together with technology and also to enable the discovery of and creation and distribution of such technology to make this work. So if AI can start churning out new scientific discoveries, that'll be wonderful. And that's personally one of the things I'm most excited about. But even to kind of get those into the hands of people and to do it in a rapid and just way, you need all of the rest of society to play its role too. And so I don't view this as, like, AI is just gonna come along and wave magic wand and fix everything. It's like AI is this new meta tool that humanity has to enable us along with all of our people, institutions, whatever, to go to greater and greater heights. poverty? If we can build AI systems that help us cure many disease figure out the cure to many diseases, that's, like, a pretty big triumph. this is not my field of expertise by far, but the people that are in it seem so excited about what this is about to unlock.
Unknown: you know, kinda like chat GPT as a as an API with some announced partners and other kinds of things. How should people think about the platform as as they are navigating their lives?
Sam Altman: I think the greatest platforms people pretty quickly forget are platforms. the first smartphones and app stores launched and all these companies were saying I'm a mobile company, And that was, like, a big deal because they were on the mobile platform. And today, it'd be ridiculous to say you're a mobile plat company because every company has a mobile part of its strategy. Probably true, all these AI companies, whatever. My hope is that ten years from now, intelligence is expected in every product and service, and it's so ubiquitous. We forget it's a platform. It's just part of everything we do. my belief is we need at least one more really big idea. I talked to a few journalists since the g p d four launch, and I would ask this question because I was curious to know more. Not useful at all, at least in the ways people have found so far for the reporting process, but very useful for the drafting, writing, synthesizing part of the process. And the ability to, like, put a bunch of notes in there, ask questions about it later, help kind of find themes between things.
Unknown: but not a game that I even cracked the box on yet, let alone co design. And so, you know, I I would say, you know, look, cross check this stuff. But the quick research assistant briefing that's done immediately in like thirty seconds Across these domains of human existence, let's say, just like when you start encountering search,
Sam Altman: I deeply believe this. It's a little too early to declare victory on it, but it certainly seems like people stay in the flow state much more, stay in the parts of the job they enjoy much more. AI is, like, good at doing the repetitive stuff that most of us just find a little bit monotonous. So anecdotally, we hear reports of this a lot.
Unknown: Yeah. Well and actually, I did that because, like, for example, part of like, usually in writing books, having done it before,
Sam Altman: Yep. Another one is we we just released this, like, very early preview of of of plugins. And I think the fact that g p t four can now, with a lot of limits, write and execute code is so cool that just as, like, a citizen of humanity, I feel delight every time even if it's just like doing something very simple.
Unknown: what you guys are learning about how to align these systems with human interest and human values as they scale.
Sam Altman: It's nice of you to say. I think we have made real progress relative to what people thought this was going to look like. But we do not know and probably aren't even close to knowing how to align a superintelligence. is very cool for what we use it for today, but thinking that the alignment problem is now solved would be a very grave mistake indeed. I am hopeful that we're gonna make better and better tools that are gonna help us come up with better and better alignment ideas. I think that that answer is exactly right because staying
Unknown: deeply focused, deeply concerned as the dynamic thing proceeds is the way to maximize safety.
Sam Altman: Well, I think it's worth being very precise here. What we do is we know how to make GPT four safe safe in the ways we know about so far. And, again, like, big surprise. Big, big success, but very and you really feel the downside. Now the downside is still really there, but using it, I think, adds some healthy caution to people too. But but it really does let people taste the upside and figure out how to participate in this new world we're all gonna create together. And I think that's great.
Unknown: And that's precisely why I created Impromptu, that can run over children, you know, causes forty thousand deaths per year in the Continental United States. Wouldn't you like to get into one? And then How do we put bumpers and automatic crash detection and other kinds of things in it, lane changes in order to make them a lot safer decade after decade You've obviously been kind of over the last couple of weeks, you know, kind of helping introduce the world to ChatGPT, gbt four. Impromptu is an effort to try to to kind of show why AI can be amazing for humanity and why I have actually belief and confidence that we really can get there just by intentionally, you know, metaphor driving driving it there. What would you say
Sam Altman: a tool of amplification, and this is a tool that makes you do better at whatever you need to do better at, and it's we can say that. It's nothing like just trying it. So just go try it out. That's my advice. And we we really hope you love it. The feedback that we get from people is very helpful as we think about future versions. People really have found new incredible things, new places where it breaks. But but, yeah, the ability to sort of in whatever way you'd like to be amplified, use this tool to amplify yourself.
Unknown: Absolutely. And it's the reason why the book description for Impromptu is it's not a read. It's the starting of a conversation.
