Unknown: So I want to do something a little bit different for this episode and just break apart a lot of your essays. So I went back That's fun. So it seems like there are several categories from observing your thoughts and then choosing what to work on and then creating actual value once you've chosen a thing. And then past that kind of purpose in general, like purpose in your work. the first quote that I liked was from your essay, the days are long but the decades are short. And that quote was, minimize your cognitive load from distracting things that don't really matter. It's hard to overstate how important this is and how bad most people are at it.
Sam Altman: I think it's very easy to spend a decade being incredibly busy and incredibly stressed every day and feeling like you're working incredibly hard and trap, it's so easy to get caught up in things that are urgent but unimportant. Or it is so easy to get caught up in, like, the trifles of office politics and playing status and power games that don't matter, but feel so fun and so important. Or or just like random other, like, bullshit that piles up in life. Mhmm. And I've at least found for myself, have, like, a a, like, fixed budget of cognitive output per day. And I can spend that on whatever. But if I let it go on unimportant stuff, then I never have time to get to the the really important stuff. And it's so easy to get heads down and focused, and sort of miss, like, what am I actually accomplishing? Yeah. The number of people who have said to me, like, man, I thought for ten years I was doing incredible work because I felt like I was creating a huge amount of output, always depressing. You do need to focus and do stuff, but, you know, I think it's, like, really good to, like, focus for some period of time and then step back and think, like, am I am I doing the right thing? You also don't wanna make the mistake that sort of, like, the stereotypical But I think, like, making But I think people find different ways to do that. Like, one specific thing I do, which has sort of become this annual ritual I really like, is, But but I I I think, like, the fundamental pattern that has always worked for me is take time, explore a lot of things, try a lot of things, try to have, like, a beginner's mind about what will work and what won't work, But trust your intuitions,
Unknown: And in terms of choosing I mean, this sort of transitions into choosing what to work on and how to create value. But in terms of establishing those metrics for, you know So say you say you have like, you know, YC Yeah. OpenAI,
Sam Altman: Like, I I am skeptical of these, like, I mean, the best thing I can say is I've, like, I follow my interests. I try to pursue a lot of projects that seem interesting. I realize that most of them will fail, and I don't care. And then the ones that, as long as the ones that work really work. Yeah. So like, OpenAI really works. YC really works. I've done plenty of other things in the last five years that have not worked at all. Should explore that because I think it's something that's not talked about and it's to the detriment of everyone. I sold my startup when I was, like, 26, something like that. And I worked at acquiring company for a little while, maybe 25. I don't remember. And then I took a year off. And in that year, which is hard to do. It's really hard to do in Silicon Valley because, I read like many dozens of textbooks. I learned about fields that I had been interested in. I didn't have any idea that they were all gonna come together in the way they did, but, like, I learned a lot about nuclear engineering. AI was starting to work, so I learned a lot about AI. I learned about synthetic biology. I traveled around a lot. I kind of like really got what the rest of the world is like. I met people, that were working on all sorts of different things, were nice enough to talk to me. I got badly needed time to reconnect with my friends and family. I just got caught up on life. And they would teach me stuff, or they would like offer me the chance to invest in their startup later. But the seeds were planted for things that worked in deep ways later. So
Unknown: Right. Okay. So, yeah. I know a few people that have gone through this. And it seems like Or maybe they just immediately jump into something start researching
Sam Altman: it takes brutal honesty with yourself about which projects are actually working and which you would like to convince yourself are working. I've And been guilty of this mistake many times, and I will many times in the future. This is a very hard thing to train yourself to do. Mhmm. To really step back and dispassionately look and say, like, am I desperately trying to convince myself this is working, or is this actually working? But I think it is a muscle that is buildable. Like, clearly, people get good at that. It's just hard because it means admitting failure in something. Like, every time I make a major investment in a company, I am convinced it's going to work. You don't go in expecting to lose your money, or at least, you know, like, I am prepared to pay for the expected value that I think is going to work. Mhmm. And and once you've anchored that, it's, like, hard to go back and be like, man, I was so wrong, which obviously The happens all the about investing in a lot of companies is you learn to be It's very humbling. You learn to be majorly wrong very frequently. And you learn that that's okay, as long as the magnitude of the successes pays for all of the failures. I
Unknown: haven't thought about this before, but say you sold your company and had some money and weren't thinking about being an angel investor. Do you think it's actually a good idea to angel invest a little bit before you start something else, even if you're not pulled in that direction?
Sam Altman: are poker and angel investing. I strongly recommend it as just a way to kind of like learn about the world and business and psychology and risk and everything else. Mhmm.
Unknown: Did you play like competitively? Alright. Cool. So you have all You wrote the productivity post fairly recently. I thought that was really fun. Thank Your
Sam Altman: And if you're trying to, like, win on really big creative ideas, much better off, like, cut something, have less of them Yeah. Whatever. But, like, for me,
Unknown: I've tried to optimize You know, like, I try not to sell my best time for anything other than the projects I wanna work on. Totally. I think everyone
Sam Altman: Like for me, it's early mornings or like the first three hours after I wake up. And like,
Unknown: So in your in your broad writing on choosing what to work on, I love the the Hamming lecture.
Sam Altman: But
Unknown: And how do you manage the psychology of multiple teams working on things that are all pointing toward AGI, but in different directions? One other thing from the days are long, but decades are short. I I liked your risk explanation.
Sam Altman: So specifically you say, things in life are rarely as risky as they seem. Most people are too risk averse and so most advice is biased too much towards conservative paths. Yeah. Mean, the risk is you look like the real what risk actually looks like is that you look back at the end of your career and you're like, fuck, I wasted it. Oh, totally. And short term catastrophic risk, and we're very bad about thinking about long term chronic risk. Like, we worry about, you know, nuclear plant meltdowns, but not about Yeah. Like, inhaling coal smoke or whatever. And so there's like a very small handful of people that I would say, like, I have taken an interest in their careers because I think they're going to, like, do amazing things in the world, and I try to spend a lot of time with for no reason other than I wanna help them. Yeah. And consistently, like, this is the thing I find myself pushing them on, which is you're thinking about you're thinking too small and you're thinking about risk the wrong way. Mhmm. Or you need a perspective shift. Man, perspective shift, that's something. I wanna write about that at some point. Like the I think as you get older, perspect getting a shift in perspective just gets harder and harder and harder, and it's an unbelievably valuable thing to get. I think this is why people end up taking, like, lots lots of psychedelic drugs. I don't know if that's the best approach. But keeping the sort of mental flexibility to look at things from fresh perspectives and new angles,
Unknown: man, that important to hold on to. Yep. It doesn't happen very often. I mean, it's like losing someone close to you, losing losing things, or the psychedelic path has become very popular. And, yeah, just on reading the research, I've been like and, you know, limited experience, you're like, oh. So it's both abstracting you from your daily habits and then giving you the motivation to pursue things that you were kind of on the fence with.
Sam Altman: The other, like, thing that I found for all of this stuff that really matters is surrounding yourself with people who will make you more ambitious, Is really important. And like, basically all people, almost like 98% Like, I love reading about sort of, like, the great the big iron science and engineering projects of history. Like like, I don't think I'd ever It's hard to imagine I would ever get tired of like reading books about the Apollo program.
Unknown: Okay. So now that, like, the the next kind of theme in a lot of your writing is about creating value. And say someone's chosen whatever they might wanna work. Yeah. In your productivity essay, you say, my system has three kill three key pillars.
Sam Altman: I think people overcomplicate it. I think this whole, like, productivity point thing where you have these, like, systems and, like, you know, like, these multivariable charts and three-dimensional whatevers. Like, those people never seem to be the people who, like, really move the world forward, I will observe. as long as it keeps you disciplined and getting done what you say you're gonna get done, is fine. And I think, like, the simple ones really work. The one thing I would say is if you're going to try to, like, multitask a lot, written lists are very helpful. Mhmm. But beyond that, I think, like, One thing that I have found helps people is if they have like a and then you lose it and people feel their productivity sag, and so they reform the groups by themselves.
Unknown: yeah, was him and three of his friends. Basically weekly emails and then quarterly check ins. It's very simple and easy to follow. Would recommend it. So the the other thing you talk about in creating value, talk about these like big projects. And there's the this other essay you wrote called what happened to innovation. And I think it's this this fear that many people have like, oh, man, all the cool shit already happened.
Sam Altman: One is people like to complain. Another is that it is true like, that's where the frontier is. That's where the best people wanna go work. And so I think it is a fair criticism to say, like, most recent big iron innovation has been on the Internet. And that is a criticism, but it's also a praise. And, like, you know, I think there's usually, like, a small handful of frontiers where the most talented people go because that's where you're making the most progress. Mhmm. And, sure, it's not physics right now, but that's okay. And I think it's like, but on a long time frame and in uncertain ways, I think we'll have some new structures to share.
Unknown: There was a point that Hamming brought about in his lecture that he said, he who works with a door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.
Sam Altman: Yeah. So this figuring out the balance of how much random flux you accept in your life for how much wasted time Yeah. Is The at some point, and it takes a long time to get here, you know, you get to, like, hire a couple of people who screen stuff for you, and that's great. But I didn't have that luxury for a long time, And there's basically two things to do. One is you take a lot of random meetings and you accept that 90% of the time, you'll waste your time and be frustrated with yourself for wasting your time for that one meeting that makes it all worth it net. Yeah. I don't know, like ten, fifteen hours per week in random stuff. I think if you cut it off entirely, it's disastrous. Like, if you don't have any, like, flow of, like, people outside your network with new ideas or just a lot of talent that is under
Unknown: Yeah. This is related I remember it was a funny moment at the hack athon like last year when you were there. There was some team who was like, we're gonna do this and then we're gonna do that and then we're gonna work on rockets or like help work on the rockets. And you said something that I thought was so great where you're like, if you wanna work on rockets, go work on rockets. Yeah. I don't believe in the deferred life plan. Yeah.
Sam Altman: like, a a a common criticism of people in Silicon Valley, who I think have great futures in their past, So what I'm going to do is spend, And they never do either. one of the many problems with the deferred life plan is everyone can kinda tell that that's what you're on. Mhmm. And you're not that serious about you're not that committed to either, I mean, it must work sometimes, but I've seen it fail a lot, lot, lot. And I understand the temptation of it, and I understand the degree to which people feel well, And I understand the temptation to, like, figure out basic financial security, of course, like, I needed that myself. But, like, I think one of the things that's amazing about Silicon Valley is you actually can raise money so if that's what you wanna do, like, just get on with it. The company will pay you a salary. Like, you'll be fine. If if you can raise money at all, you'll be fine. If you can't raise money, like, think about something else. But it is I mean, I could go on such a long rant that I will just bore people and piss people off. But I would say you don't if what you wanna work on is like an ambitious company and you are in Silicon Valley and you are competent, Yeah. It's like people can sense authenticity. People can sense people's motivation. People can sense if you're doing something because like, if you're doing something for the right reasons. And I think, like, to succeed at anything, it's important that people are rooting for you. It's important that people want you to win, investors, the press, your team, whatever. And and I think that's one of another one of the many problems with the with the deferred life plan. Mhmm. Yeah. People of seemingly like any takes a long time, and it takes a lot of, like, emotional trauma, like a lot of people telling you you're an idiot or wrong or whatever.
Unknown: We'll see. So you wrote an essay, The Merge, a while And you said, our self worth is so based on our intelligence that we believe it must be singular and not slightly higher than all the other animals on a continuum. Perhaps the AI will feel the same way and note that the differences between us and bonobos are barely worth discussing. this is a common topic, right? Work, purpose, UBI even. Where do you think that's going in AGI era, if it happens?
Sam Altman: Look, I think people find you know, running a esports team, I think that's, like, as valid as trying to build AGI. The thing I hate is just people who are apathetic and proud of it. But, yeah, like, I think that the the definition of there are, like, I think what seem to be some human universals about ways that we get meaning in life, like human relationships Feeling like we're creating value for others, like feeling like other people think highly of us and respect us. There are many ways to do those things. And I think one thing that will happen with this sort of arrival of AGI is intelligence. Like, I got lucky. I got born reasonably smart, sixty thousand years ago, like, running around, intelligence wasn't that much of a benefit. Like, physical strength, endurance, much more important. Sixty thousand years from now, human biological intelligence, don't think will be that much of a benefit again. You're you're heavy lifting, right? Heavy lifting. You feel better? I do. I do. Much better than doing like heavy cardio.
Unknown: Yeah. Well, thing with that like, I've shifted over to lifting this year. Yeah. think the the last thing is like, what what are you reading right now?
Sam Altman: it's really short. I recommend it a lot. It's called The Way to Love by Anthony DeMello. It'll take you like an hour to read. It was recommended to me by Naval. Okay. And it is a series of meditations on
