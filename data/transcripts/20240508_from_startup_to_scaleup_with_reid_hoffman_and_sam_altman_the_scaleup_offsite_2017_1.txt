Unknown: Stanford topic, but this is actually a good topic for essentially our network and for the businesses because you really only build something amazing if you hit the scale problem. Right? It's not just a, hey, you invent. and if you fail, you fail. The hallway conversations are private, so don't tweet produces so much of the technological impact in the world, and a ton of talent here, and the venture capital stuff all works. you'll find that most people in the Valley all say network effects as something super important.
Sam Altman: Well, you know, it gets super recursive because one of the things that we did was start our continuity fund because we realized this problem to scale ourselves. We realized that if we didn't start a growth fund that could help companies who have had their initial idea start to work, then we weren't going to be able to produce as many impact companies as we can, which is really why we started our own growth stage fund. It invests mostly in YC companies. We sometimes invest in non YC companies, but the idea was can we this thing basically to scale YC, we need to scale companies. And that I think has been one of the most important inventions we've had in the last year. We've also tried to go in the other direction. So right now we're teaching a MOOC which is kind of the third version of that Stanford class back at Stanford where we are advising 3,000 startups at once. I think this is probably a world record for number of startups concurrently advised by one program. And next year we think we can scale that to 10,000. And this is you know teaching people a lot of the YC experience about how to start a company. And the thing that I really try to do in terms of scaling YC is make sure we don't have to compete with other firms. You managed to do it very well, but most venture capitalists that have to compete have a tough time of it, spend a lot of time thinking about it. And we like to be the only people that are sort of that really matter in our own space. And so for us,
Unknown: and very rarely are the right people that when you're executives at 20 or 50 are the right people for executives when you're a thousand or 500. managing your connectivity with those folks in a way that if you're promising this person that they're gonna be head of product or head of sales or head of marketing or head of engineer forever,
Sam Altman: I had a funny example of this late last year. Someone was writing a story about YC, and they wrote something about how And I stand by my read of it. But I think like the the amount of dynamism that the the startups that really scale well have always looks a little chaotic on the outside. It's just because there's constant shuffling of new people in and people who aren't working out out. The very best founders that we've worked with, one of the things that they always evaluate their people on is how good have they been at training their replacements, how good are they at you know on moments notice being able to move to a next role. Because most founders are very bad at this and most people are very bad at this. You know most executives will not do this. You know there was a story at Facebook at one point that they tied like 50% of executives' bonus to how good of a job they were doing at having replacements ready to go and being ready to move into a new role. I think if you don't really incentivize it, never get enough of that culture in place.
Unknown: there will be chaos. We're trying to constantly manage it, but we don't manage to zero chaos until we're actually in a relatively stable place. And so expect that,
Sam Altman: the wrong way to address that is to like say, okay, my team says they don't want chaos. in exchange for a shot at one of these massive great companies
Unknown: and founders just have to sell that to their teams. It's hard. And it's a management dynamic. Cast will go up, you do some solidity. Cast will go up, you do some solidity. It's that dynamic. This is a classic MBA thing, which is like, oh, hire the people who have the experience at that job, get the CV of it, put that CV in, make that happen. So I literally had job description to history and was optimizing for that. The other parts of the learning and adjusting is the whole organization is gonna change shape. a host. This is actually part of when I got to PayPal and was kind of when Peter and Max and I were going on walks about how to first build what was first called FieldLink, then Confinity, then PayVal.
Sam Altman: but unfortunately it's usually like twenty years of the exact same year of experience over and over again and they probably can't learn and adapt if something really changed and things are really going to change. If you're trying to scale fast, you really need someone who is aligned with the values of the company so that when things change or when they have to make a decision they'll make the one you would make if you can't be in there or they will be a good player, a good team player and go do that thing. You need someone who has high aptitude because the role is gonna constantly shift. And the speed, the ability, the rate of learning, the rate of improvement dominates skills. And then you know specific skills experience obviously matter, but for me it's third on the list. Speaking of YC continuity, Ollie who runs our continuity fund model of how you hire executives in a non growing, very static company and think that in a blitzscaling company you have to flip the priority of skills, you end up or the priority of attributes, you end up with a very different team but it's the one that works. And, the very best companies take this exceptionally far in how much they're willing to hire
Unknown: most need to solve and then getting the generalist into it. Because one of the things that you do need to eventually, as you scale, hire specialists, but the theme that you look at as you move from startup to scale up is you always have generalists. The generalists are important for learning, changing the organization, adapting, adapting product market fit, tackling new markets, going global, etcetera. But you still very selectively add in the specialists. When you have someone who says, look, I am just a network engineer, you're like, okay, great. That's when we know that what we need from you is network engineering where I asked them. I said, Look, there's two theories of thought in Silicon Valley. One theory is that culture eats strategy and that culture is the dependent thing for how you really build great companies. is that, again, when you look at the traits of you're going to be fairly consistently. As you reorganize, that culture won't survive as you really balloon the organization. Instead, you want a horizontal accountability. You want it so that everybody is keeping everyone else accountable to the culture that we're in, and Cultures are not like there is the good culture and the bad culture. Cultures are defined by an organization. Some cultures are engineering cultures. Some cultures are high IQ cultures. Some cultures are collaborative teamwork cultures. The problem is it doesn't just end there. You actually do have to play good strategy and everything else. So the thing that when people frequently sell culture too much is they say, once you have good culture, everything else follows because you hire the right people, you play the right way together, and that's of course extremely important, but if you don't get the business model and the strategy right. How do you guys teach culture at YC? What's the particular
Sam Altman: I think there are so many different kinds of cultures that can work, and I'm certainly a believer that you have to have a great business and a great culture, and they can be somewhat orthogonal, also if you, you know, if you take one business' culture and throw it into another successful business, it might be disastrous. So they really do somehow have to fit together. The general framework that I think about when net effect on the output vector of the organization? moderately intelligent and moderately productive but have a hugely positive impact on what they get everybody else to do. And I think like one version of culture is are you good at bringing in people that have a positive net effect on the output vector? culture that matters I think to the best people is one where they can just come and be really productive and be around really other great people. And if you have a culture which is which looks good on the surface but somehow rejects super talented people or is just it's covering up for constant infighting, 2017 subsequently get lower. And so, you know, this idea of how important it is to have people that are going to join a company and stay there for five or ten years sounds like a crazy thing to say because no one does that anymore. which one of the things that is included in that is wild success for the company and the mission that people care about. That's really important. But getting people who are there for that and not there for the green tea, which is like an think an easy way people think about culture in the wrong way at the beginning, is super important. You need to create an environment where
Unknown: forever. We're actually a team, and we should basically that's that kind of culture and should I work there? I really like the fact that they're shaped that way, that that particular way of playing, that particular sports theme, that's the sports theme that's the right kind of thing for me. I think many more organizations should actually be much more explicit about that, because they don't talk about, Oh, we have cafeterias.
Sam Altman: we see a lot of these value statements in culture decks and the problem is they're only valuable to the degree they're different from what other companies say. Yes. So most of the ones we see because we suggest that every company write those out and it's like we value integrity. We value being a team player. Be excellent. Be excellent. Yes. And so I think this is a worthwhile exercise and it's good to do but only to the extent that what you say is different from what other people would say. Yeah. And trying to figure that out is really important. And what honestly what most companies find when they do this or what many companies find is that they have nothing to say that wouldn't be in sort of
Unknown: filter would have a players working at other companies than yours? Which A players do you not want working at your company? What is that? That shows you that you begin to have something that's kind of an edge in a culture and begins to approach the uniqueness. Now another part of scaling is hiring changes. So classically in your first ten, twenty, 5,100, When you say, okay, we hire people, and then all 15 people start at the same day so that we train them on our company in the same pattern in order to make that efficient and so forth. That's part of this whole hiring process. So you also not only have to think about org, I'm gonna shift topics to communications within the company. Classically, when you're at an early stage, communications pattern, but it's the kind of communications pattern that shows you. When she started at Google,
Sam Altman: Certainly when you get to the stage where people that were used to knowing everything don't know everything, I think more early employees leave over that than anything else. It's really tough to say what to do about that. It's people that have gone from being sort of absolutely in the inside to not. but in my experience when you really talk to someone about why they're leaving, you know someone that joined this employee five of a super successful company now has 500 people, that's almost always
Unknown: in kind of some different lunch groups and just where we had lunch and could talk about the company so they still felt that they had an
Sam Altman: He used to spend or still does spend like 20 of his 30 nights a month taking key Airbnb employees that don't report to him out to dinner. And it's just like, let's talk. I'll tell you about stuff. And he's super open, so he'll talk about a lot. And I think like that level of commitment, like I'm gonna take 20 of my 30 nights a month and use it to sort of keep close to early people who otherwise sometimes fell out of the loop is huge. The other thing on communication that people get wrong as you scale, and we're supposed to go to questions so I'll make this a short point, is how much time you have to spend repeating the same message.
Unknown: The other key thing is to decide when you really need to hit the gas because part of what the blitzscaling stuff is, you actually deploy capital in a fast and inefficient way in order to get to scale and or global scale. Sometimes that's competition. Sometimes that's market opportunity. Sometimes that's critical mass density and networks.
Sam Altman: and I think like you should the entire company should be aligned like hire reasonably slowly? Or are we in the mode where we got things to work and we know what to do and we are now going to like almost no company or to explain the company's mission, almost no company can do that and have everyone say the same thing. But this like, are we in hyper scale mode or not? It's very rare that one company has a cohesive opinion on that and that they all flip at the same time.
Unknown: One, as we mentioned, is culture. Another is the question, generally speaking, changes of mission are really bad, so the mission should also be there. To some degree everyone is we're in service of the mission, not we have this role in the specific organization. Then generally speaking But it tends to be the this is the investment thesis and set of hypotheses that we're testing out. What tends to not be as much as
Sam Altman: You know, people like winning. People like the lighting customers. People like it if there's just this like mass demand and this huge upward draft behind what you're doing. One of the reasons I think why trying to hyperscale a company that is not winning fails is because without that, then all of these problems of people having their turf stepped on and the occasional bad hire you have to get out, people have a lot of time to think about how unhappy those things make them. And if things just keep getting better and there's more opportunity than you can possibly take on and that everyone constantly has new expanding roles and so they don't get caught up in these turf wars, then it works. But I think this is one of the reasons it's so important to not flip into hyperscaling mode until you're pretty sure the product is working. Because without this natural updraft of a market that is desperate for your product and a feeling that everyone is winning every day and the company is doing just fantastically well, then all of the things that go wrong when you try to blitzscale can break the company. So I think the key thing for me is don't try to do this until you're confident you have this updraft.
Unknown: they have unique talent. Similarly, say we know we're gonna need to be operational efficient. We know we're gonna need to be focused on operating margins and how costs work and how scale works and everything else in a capital efficient model, When it's actually in fact get to scale, then obsess with operating margins. Because if you're not at scale, your operating margins don't matter.
