Unknown: Yeah. What a time to be alive. Welcome everyone. Thanks so much for coming. It's a I've been thinking about this moment, this particular moment right now for I mean, I think we talked about having this conversation maybe three weeks ago And I was kind of excited about the beginning. And then the more and more I've been thinking about it, to the point that like my drive out here, I drove from Colorado, about thirty seven hours altogether with driving and sleeping and shopping, I spent the majority of it either calling my friends, artists and people whose opinions I really value and talking to them about it and then talking to myself about it in the car and where we're at. And I think that just to preface what we're about to talk about, I feel that right now we're at in my lifetime, in the forty four years that I've been alive, pivotal moment of a new epoch of human beings and our relationship with creativity, with our imagination, and with our relationship to creative tools will never it's the genie is out of the bottle, it'll never be the same. And I thought this is a really great moment in time for us to talk about this in front of you guys. We're going do some questions and answers. And I feel that Sam is one of the most qualified persons on the planet to be able to answer some of the questions I have and explain his thoughts and ideas around it. And I have my own questions and thoughts and I also want to be you know, kind of be their stand in and advocate and express, I know, a lot of the thoughts and concerns they have too. And we're really curious to what you guys think after you hear both of our sides and ideas around this. Sound good?
Sam Altman: I think we have figured out how to do that. And again, it's the very, very beginning. But this exponential curve that we're on, that'll get really good. That'll get like indistinguishable
Unknown: certifiably or subjectively the most brilliant genius that I know as a creative thinker. He's like, he's an artist that makes mediums. You know, the things we've done, we've done Sydney Opera House, Empire State Building. And so, he was one of the first people that I really wanted to get on the phone to kind of work this through and talk for a few hours. And there was a moment where we were sort of contemplating. It's like because like I said, I think what I really what I really want to make clear is that based off my very limited data set of my experiences, I don't I have no qualifications for to predict where this is going to go. And I I do think it's actually impossible for anyone to be able to predict. There's too many factors. Too much acceleration even any kind of speculation is it's just that. It's these aren't predictions. But it is I will say that a lot of the predictions whether it's as I get older and more cynical, I'm you know, I think we're a more avoidant of pain than seeking pleasure. And it's a lot of the conversations I had with my friends like got pretty dark pretty quick. And when you start exploring the depths of the the downside of this, I did I did consider the moments like, man, you know, it I mean, at this point, the genie is out of the bottle and like Pandora has opened this box and there's no, you know, you're leading us into a you you admit that like nobody can predict where we're going and you're leading us into a future like kind of like an explorer but you can't bring us back. And a lot of people aren't you weren't voted, you know, it's like, look at all the energy we spend on like elections and having this little puppet in power and meanwhile, there's a group of really brilliant individuals that can create a tool and that will fundamentally change. You are meddling with the primal forces of humans relationship with the creative experience forever. given the it's like the Pandora's box when you when you play with curiosity and you open these new possibilities, you also invite terrible unforeseen circumstances and conclusions. Just seeing where we're at, where we could be and how bad it could be, there was the moment where I did entertain the idea of like, man, if I could go back like Terminator, like if like I would potentially sacrifice my life to like maybe strangle you or like have like, I've got like a bomb here and just if I knew that like I could safeguard this from ever happening to art and all the artists that I would save, I'd let go of everything for that and I don't have that. even entertaining a possibility of murdering someone to avoid future that could be so terrible. But I will say that after that like I've gone up and down. It's been a roller on the positives and the negatives of this. But You're totally safe. I feel I feel you're even safer now that I got that out and express that. We did have one conversation a few weeks ago and it was really pleasant. But like since then, talking to more people and it's like it's such a huge concept that it really takes a lot of time to just soak in and just explore the probabilities of where this can go. And I've come to the conclusion that time for debating the possibility of this is as you know is is is we're never we're never going back. And so we have to embrace the 100% probability this is where we're at. And if you were just one like, you know, like that that that fantasy was like kinda going back in time to killing Hitler, like it's it's it's not just you. It's mid journey. It's stable diffusion. It's disco diffusion. I have to the if I can I think it's important to see that this is a movement that's happening with technology and humans and what we're creating that's unstoppable. And so that if seeing the unstoppability of it is something that makes me more compliant to try to I've got three kids. I've got a five year old and a four year old and a 11 old. And so I'm invested in the future. Know, I can't be cynical. I can't doom and gloom. Like, I want to be able to take steps into making the future and creating as many the largest probability bubble of goodness for my children and all the children. So I love making art. The experience of making art is it's the greatest blessing that I've had in my life before my children. I studied drawing and painting, old masters. I dissected cadavers to learn anatomy. Like the things, the journey that I went to develop the craft and the muscle memories is extensive and it's given me a feeling of like pride and dignity and identity and I don't know who I would be. I would not be the man in front of you if I didn't have the outlet of expressing myself creatively through my hands, through the craft and I'm a fan of tools that enhance humans ability to manifest their imagination and their ideas On a from a creative imaginative level. And the And then I got access to Midjourney, which is a very similar Midjourney though specifically has really seemed to hone its dataset in on conceptual development and concept art and different artists. And I saw some really incredible stuff coming out and like week by week I got more unbelievable to the point where it's like, okay, let me really try this out. And the process is you make prompts and so you prompt and say, hey, I want something like this in the style of this, da da da da da, and it starts making images. And I was on a phone with was at a I was talking to this psychedelic Australian Cytrance Festival that wanted me to do some art for them and they were describing their event and just like in the last five minutes, like, what's the name of the event? Oh, Wild Wastelands. What kind of colors you're looking? Like, I had 20 poster designs I felt almost confident with a little over painting I could have just submitted that were created in the last five minutes of the conversation. And from there, the rabbit hole just got deeper. And if this wasn't a real thing, I'd be the first one to be trying to to to argue to John Henry this that that humans have any possibility of competing with this. But you know, the woo woo, the art for art's sake. And I but I I think right now where where things are at I did it for five years, worked for Nintendo. A huge group of my friends are conceptual artists. The idea of being able to support yourself as someone that is drawing and making images with the skills that you've developed from your imagination that could in any way shape or form compete with this type of image creation is absolutely obsolete. It's over. Like that entire career path is designated. It's just no that's no longer going to be a thing. I think that's when it comes to we never I mean, so funny, thought about it, none of my visionary art friends ever saw this coming, you know? And the conceptual, I think entertainment will be the first to see the biggest impact. And yeah, it'll just start spreading from there.
Sam Altman: engineering, management, stuff like that. So I feel this too because that's like my identity. That's what I love, like my version of creative expressionist companies. But for me, intelligence is about how do I go decide I want to do something brand new inherently somehow, learn to go do that thing by myself, and then go do it. And so, right now, like, the AI can follow instructions. It can look like it's it is creating in some sense, right? It's like generating a new image for you. But I think this is still somewhat more of a parlor trick than it looks. And although I think, like, as you said, the kind of commercial art jobs are gone, and it doesn't do anyone any good for us, or you to pretend otherwise,
Unknown: So, there's no I have no debate over the value of artificial intelligence. And when when I look at that from an artist perspective, look at the world and you look at we have so many there's so many problems out there dealing with like humanity and where we're going and the environment and our consciousness. The question I have is that like out of all these things that AI could benefit that that humans could benefit like, what problem those persnickety artists, they think they're so special. Oh, their skills and their crafts. You know? Like, I didn't see anybody clamoring, let's put them all out of business. I love mashing up artists, like different artists from different I did like I did the other day. I did like a I love Igor Schiele, it's one of favorite German expressionisms. or touching things up or doing portraits. So that's cool. That's safe. A week goes on, they put a new beta, I did one of like the prompt was like Elon Schiele and Egon Musk. And it made a portrait of Elon Musk in the style of of Elon Schile. It was like, it's so it's so it's so terrifying. It's kind of like it's like like watching a skit the more I play with it, it's like watching a scary movie to, like, see when, like, the jump scare of the monster monster comes comes out. Out. So there's a cleverness involved in the prompts. There's some understanding and there's also this slot machine you know, generate and you see what comes up and then each one of those you can refine it more, you can oppress it, refine it more. And it's I mean, it's it's it's a god it's a god like power. Absolutely. When you say superpower. And so, I can see that like a lot of people have these ideas in their heads that they've never been they can't afford a concept artist. They can't put it out there. They're not good at drawing. They didn't spend their time with that craft. I could see that like that the novelty of it is very cool and very interesting. It's it's the the deeper implications and the consequences I mean, zooming out, like, as a like, one of my fundamental spiritual ideas is that as I believe in a creator and I believe that we were created to create. I see that we're kind of a generative recursive algorithm of consciousness. I mean, I'm open to the idea that maybe our grand purpose is to give birth to a new type of silicon consciousness. I'm I'm I will say I'm a really big fan of I consider ourselves water consciousness, big fan of water consciousness. Super great. Very little nerve of a to of giving birth to never before. This is the greatest evolutionary pressure that creative artists will ever face in any any of our lifetimes. And so from that, where you've raised the bar to such a ridiculous level and, you know, honestly too, it's like supporting yourself as an artist like was was that bar not high enough? Like it wasn't high enough already, so you threw it into the stratosphere. I'm a big believer and lover of humans. I'm sure you love humans too. There will be artists that break through that glass ceiling and prove to humanity that there's something inside of us that may never be able to be recreated. You listen to like Nina Simone, like there's something about like the physical, the human pouring his soul into something. I'd like to think that art is at first, I was like, well, you know so just the zoo out too, a lot of the things they'll be expressing are gonna sound really similar to all the stages of of grief while dying. You know? There's like the argument. There's the anger that I expressed. There's the denial. what makes art really valuable is I'd like to think that what makes my art powerful is like I'm really I'm much more into the process than I am the product of the art. Me being able to express my consciousness, the experience of being creative, just like the flow of that, the tapping into something that's bigger than me, just the excitement. I like to think my woo woo that I I'm able to, you know, I use psychedelics so I can see the truth of myself. I wanna make something that's true and I wanna put everything I can into that and I wanna think that something about that, you know, the the pixels or the the final image is just the residue of that experience. I think I had that idea from like maybe like a few days until I really started thinking of it is that it's just a matter of time and I think it's really about the size of the data set that it's looking at. Because like I said, you can see on my legs there's something so profound, like the highest point, there's something so profound and moving about that honestly, what's what's what is terrifying about the exponential acceleration is I I believe that as mind blowing as what's happening right now, I mean, with this with this with this type of like acceleration, four or five years or I don't know how whatever whatever time frame you feel, what what's the what's what's the experience of someone, What's great example of like a high level creative experience for the future artist?
Sam Altman: and have this real time feedback, which I think, at least in my own experience with the creative process, it's super important and something that's very much missing right now. But you'll have this sort of real time loop where you'll just talk in natural language and express yourself and you'll see things and it'll change the way you think and you'll change the way the generation happens. And that'll be across images, video, audio, probably other formats, maybe some new formats we don't even really think about today. I am optimistic, Optimistic that like we are all gonna get art that is amazing beyond any of our expectations right now.
Unknown: I'd like to counterpoint the gaining more than we lose kind of perspective too. So where type of like an You know? Like, it's it's like it's a fundamental level I accept that. Okay. One area that I definitely go to a lot, I guess I kinda mentioned earlier, just the experience of drawing and painting and the evolution I've gone from crayons to acrylic to pixels to polygons to vertexes to point clouds, like I I love all of it, you know. I love and embrace like all those things. But particularly, you know, art and there's there's an interesting conversation between art as the commercial art that you're gonna make money with and art for the sake of art and the value that that is. Like I said, I feel that they create for me, I had a lot of trauma growing up and for me, art was the only way that I could heal from that trauma. And art as a the drawing and painting as a point of friction for my consciousness, is one of the most amazing pieces of friction to have those realizations and kind of come to that. But if I think of all the joy that art has given me, and what I'm concerned about is that I feel that not only is this sort of the death of the inner right now, the entertainment artists, it feels like it's the death of craft and drawing and painting as we know it. Because at the same time, I don't think that I would been been able to dedicate so much of my life and my time to discovering these skills that that gave me a sense of worth, gave me a sense of dignity, if there wasn't some type of carrot out there that yeah, if I keep doing this well I'll get a job of that too. When we take away, it's all incentives. You guys are always about incentives. When you take away the incentive that this skill will add any value, existential value to you surviving. How many years and how many generations until it becomes irrelevant? And what's the point of drawing and painting? Like how far is that going to go when my daughter can just say, hey, I want to see a series with rainbow unicorn kittens exploring the Polar Arctic through a hyperdimensional, you know, whatever. Whatever they can say they will see. So what is that gonna do to right now. And what's the mental health landscape going to be by doing something that robs the future of all the dignity that humans develop through the exercise of these crafts and these skills? And what's going to replace that? Because in my experience of the prompts and the it's interesting, but it there's a hollow. Like, I don't feel I really made any of this. I haven't posted anything. I wouldn't sell any of these things. Like, I felt kind of clever that I arrived at them, But there's no sense of like there's there's no way to compare this to the satisfaction of bringing an image from nothing and sharing it with people. So I feel that we may be at kind of like the kind of the last stage of these organic artists that operated like this because this will change. Like, it's a it's a it's a BC and an AD for art. This is the honest maybe there's a great future out there, but like right now, like the amount of pain and despair and anxiety that my community of artists is feeling because this new thing you released, all of their dreams are on fire what would be your response to these these very real consequences? And I just mean, are we as humans and culture with the way as as our relationship to art and creating art as a form of expression has defined us? And what are we when we take part of that away and we're giving that to this tool? but I want to give you the opportunity. What is the what's this bright future that's worth this sacrifice that everybody is making without their consent?
Sam Altman: a relatively small group of people, the sort of, the handful of efforts working towards very powerful general AI are making decisions about what's, you know, what's gonna happen. And I think one of the things that we hope to do by releasing products like this is to get the world to pay attention. Because I think if we don't have a global conversation about this, where people who are in their very busy lives take the time to think about this and decide what the rules are going to be, what we all want, how the future's going to look, is how little people have cared.
Unknown: over promised and under delivering, you know, like where's my jetpack? Where's my flying car? Where's my self driving car? You know, any of those things. And like this is something that I think it's impossible. Like I am a believer in the exponential and unpredictable potential that this kind of technology
Sam Altman: number one, we think more AI in the world is going to be, on balance, very good. There will be bad parts, for sure. And this feels like we're at the beginning of a major recompilation of the way society works. But we could have had a similar conversation before the Industrial Revolution, before the Agricultural Revolution, before the Computer Revolution. And I very deeply believe that human ingenuity, creativity, desire to do things to help others, to make Burning Man, I really believe that although I can't And then, finally, like to paint the big upside picture here. resources, opportunity, tools to help them. And kind of what I hope for is that the benefits of AGI, so like, you know, universal basic income at massive scale, where like everyone is just like unimaginably well off.
Unknown: if I could ask you like where this is going, I wish you had a really strong, powerful, positive future that I could believe in or the mid journey guys did or the stable diffusion guys. The fact that you don't is what terrifies me about this and what makes my mind want to like, if they're not thinking about if if they don't know where this is going, where where is the it's it's it's the the asymmetrical balance of of value and power. Like making art and using that like there's something that we like we humans, we need a purpose. Like, getting all of our food and our ass wiped and free Netflix is not gonna make humanity any, like, stronger or better, like, space faring people. Like, we need challenges. You have created an incredible challenge to oversee. But when you talk about the technical revolutions or agriculture revolutions, no one's really gonna argue and the and and fact that we that people loved digging ditches or, you know, hammering railroads. And so, away physical labor that was literally killing people, it's yeah. So, these people are gonna lose their jobs, but taking away the any incentive for an organic creative experience from people. You're taking away one of the nectar aspects of conscious life on this planet. And what are you giving us in return for that? Like a a a beautiful imagination appendix slot machine of possibilities. And how are we gonna extract or find value in ourselves when so much of the heavy lifting is this exponentially intelligent tool that just gets better and faster and knows us more and more. It's like it's we're so outpaced. Like, I feel like such a relic already. And we're not even we haven't even like we're not even at the opening credits. We're at the ending credits Like, it's over, people. Like, digital image creation is over and we're just the canary in the coal mine.
Sam Altman: if we can create powerful tools that leave humans in charge, we will find ways to be far better off. And I disagree with the point that at the previous revolutions, there weren't people fighting it tooth and nail. I love to go back and sort of read the history of these and read what people said in real time. But there actually was a lot of people saying, like, what's gonna be we're not gonna have jobs. What's gonna be the meaning? I get up and work every day. I nail this railroad. I'm proud of this. This is my thing. I did this. The chance that I don't think we figure out how use that for a radically better and more creative future in ways that we can't sit here and imagine, just like we weren't able to imagine what the computer would do to society and creativity, which, again, did negatively and positively impact a lot of jobs. Like, we're gonna get that again. And there's, like, nothing that I have seen in the history of humanity to suggest that if we can find the right guardrails, if we can figure out a way to share governance of that, and access and benefits, Yes, we don't get to create images anymore
Unknown: I will admit that my limitations, that my positive imagination is is failing, you know, over like it's definitely winning out and I'm it's big not calling for a lot of people, it's a compromise that they make. all of our recorded human history, artists and creatives had a monopoly on being able to take an idea, a concept, something their imagination and manifested and execute that in a visual form that other people could see and it's the taking away like, I just what is it gonna look like for something? This isn't building better railroads but it's taking away the opportunity of all these people to express that type of creative value because it's not that it's a little bit better. I mean, we are our imaginations are just completely obsolete compared to what this is going to make possible.
Sam Altman: one thing AI can do now is maybe some truck drivers love it. I agree, probably not that many. Artists, many artists really love it. And they get deep satisfaction from that. Society gets the benefit from the art. Many scientists really love what they do too and get incredible personal satisfaction from doing their job, the thrill of discovery, being the one to do it, having the world know that they're one to do it and also just the deep And the question is,
Unknown: So I get to choose between my daughter continuing wanting to be an artist or not curing cancer?
