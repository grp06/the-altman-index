1: it's hard to really have an impact. I think most people kind of just fall into what they work on. They don't give it much thought. And there is benefit to that. Sometimes you actually have to just try stuff to figure out what you like. But I really do think it is worth upfront thought about what you're going to spend most of your waking time doing. So I think it's really good when people think about I think I'll tell you some things I've learned and I will admit that I don't have a perfect answer to this yet. But I think one thing is you should be willing to move. For whatever you're doing there tend to be pockets of it around the world where there are similar people that are doing great work in whatever field you care about. And it's really worth trying to go be be near them. I think has been really valuable for a for a lot of people. I think another thing I've helped people for for no immediate benefit and with no intention of ever getting a benefit at all, time and again in my career, it has really later benefited me a lot. So I think together. Or we're able to like work on OpenAI together, any number of things. Well, there's a Charlie Rose quote on this that I've always loved and I've since added one more element to it. But the quote is that the way things get done in the world are through a combination of focus and personal connection. And the additional point I would make after having thought about it for a while is that the third factor is self belief. personal connections, and self belief, in my experience are are how things get done in the world. If you work really hard at the beginning of your career and you get a little bit better at what you do every day, every week, every year, and you learn more and you meet more people and you just get more done, there's a compound effect. And it's far better to put that time in at the beginning of your career than at the end, because if you do it at the beginning, get to benefit from it, you know, one thing I always try to do is, like, meet every person I had time for, go to every, you know, go to everything I could, that is really valuable. And so obviously you don't want to work all the time because you're twenties or your twenties. But I do think you want to work harder than most people think you should. And I think that if you do that, you tend to benefit from it later. Life is super unfair. Sometimes you also just get unlucky. And and so all you can do is kind of maximize chances there. But I do think that working hard early in your career to get the leverage and the compounding effects is underrated and one of the most valuable pieces of advice that I never got. Yeah. This this is really hard. Knowing when to quit and knowing when to give up on something is there's no perfect answer to that, but it's really challenging to even get that approximately correct. I think most people give up on things way too early. because they give up on everyone before it could ever possibly be successful. when a lot of other people would have given up. And either people said it sucks or people said nothing at all. And a framework that I have for when to give up and when to keep working is it should be an internal, not an external decision. If people aren't using it or if people are saying it's bad, that alone is not a reason to give up. You wanna pay some attention to that. They might be right. But I think the best entrepreneurs I know, they make an internal decision about when to give up or when to keep working on something. It's basically when you have run out of ideas and something is not working, then it's a good time to stop. Yeah. I think if you don't actually believe what you're doing, it's really important. If you don't derive satisfaction from what you're doing, then you will not be able to sustain all of the bad things that happen in the incredibly long period of time that the bad things happen over. And so the the only motivation that I have seen work for people, over a long period of time is enjoyment in what they're doing and an intense belief that it matters, and ideally liking the people that they go to work with every day. But the at this point, I am sort of only interested in things that I find sort of interesting and important. And early on, like a lot of other people, I think I was like, well, I wanna make money. I wanna, you know, like, be in the press or whatever else. And I wouldn't say that doesn't motivate me at all, but it's honestly not a big factor at this point. Yeah. I wanna work on this. I think another point about motivation that is that people don't talk about enough And at least in my own experience, what I found is that burnout actually comes from failing and things not working. Momentum is really energizing. The lack of momentum is super draining. assume that they just can't work hard enough or not have enough energy or passion or whatever. yeah, I think people have terrible risk calculus in general. Even people who try to be really good about this are bad at it. The answer, I think, is almost always a, you're wrong about what is risky and what is not risky, and b, most people don't take enough risk, especially early in your career. Being young and unknown and poor, that is actually a great gift in terms of the amount of risk you can take. And I think people don't capitalize on that enough. I think what risk actually looks like is regretting. And there's a quote, know, people regret way more the things they didn't do than things that they did do. So if you really believe in something, there's an idea that you're super passionate about, you know, and you take a calculated risk to start a company realizing you may forego a couple of years of steady income and another job and whatever else, and maybe people call you a failure or whatever, that's a great risk to take. And if you don't take that risk, think you have a very high chance that you end up regretting that. I think the wrong kind of risk to take is where people don't actually do things or don't commit to something because they don't want to fail, and they overrate the risk of failure and their reputation damage or embarrassment or whatever. I think And the the reason that people don't do stuff, one is it's hard and two is it's risky. And so you have these people that, you know, wanna dabble on a bunch of different projects but never be all in on one. And I think it's this combination of work and risk. And it's you know, I think that's really bad. I think history belongs to the doers. And I think you should take a risk. Actually do something. Don't just sit around and talk and organize and bring together groups and go to thought leadership conferences and whatever it is these people spend their time on other than actually building something. This was one of the other things I learned that I wish I had gotten advice on early in my career is ask for what you want. shoot themselves in the foot because they don't ask that person to quit their job and come join them. They don't ask this big company to do a deal with them. And they're just not aggressive enough. And I think you being willing to ask what you want and and be somewhat aggressive are really important characteristics of being an entrepreneur. People don't wanna fail. They don't want to be told no. They don't want to end up in some crisis. Another thing that I learned, and I I won't even say I wish someone told me this one because I don't think it's a lesson anyone can teach you. You have to just live through it, there are a lot of things that really go wrong, and they feel like company killing events. And they feel like there's no way you're going to survive because the crises are really bad. And the thing you learn is that you generally do survive these and and that the world doesn't usually end. And even if in the moment something happens, you have no idea how you're going to get around it, you eventually figure out a way. And and because of that, but the one way I do is is by making a long term commitment to something. I think that And I think, you know, in a world where people are increasingly focused on the tick and the quarterly earnings cycle, you should try and go in the other direction. And this is a great way to generate value and wealth. And and so I think that when you're thinking about a startup, it's really worthwhile to think about something you're willing to make a very long term commitment to because that is where the current void in the market is. I I think, you know, you get paid as a founder for the wealth you create for other people. So there's this view of the world that business is all about, like, trying to steal money, and sometimes that's true. But but the the best companies just create massive amounts of value for the world and then they capture some of that for themselves, but they capture far less than they create. And they do it over a very long period of time. I think you wanna make a super long term commitment to yourself and others that are gonna work on it with you that this is gonna take a long time. But it is worth waiting because you will make far more money over the long horizon by doing this company really well than a bunch of short term things along the way. So how much do you think people should have strong opinions about things versus you know, we should have a social graph and an online directory, that is Facebook has stayed pretty similar to that, although the product itself has changed a lot along the way. And I think that's really good. That is a strong idea with flexibility in the implementation. And I think that's much better than the we're just gonna keep trying random ideas because we wanna have a start up. I I think strong strong opinions about the future are really important. And I think one of the things that I have noticed among the most interesting, the most successful people that I spend time with is that they have strong opinions strongly held about the future. They are willing to be convinced with new data that they are wrong, but the bar for that is fairly high. And this idea that the future is fundamentally unknowable, I I've never liked. Actually, I I remember pretty clearly this time where I was sort of like spouting advice someone else had given me in high school or college about how you know, you need to diversify and invest in because the world is unknown and unknowable. And so all you can do is have the most balanced possible portfolio. and I realized that I really didn't agree with that at all because I had strong opinions. And then I knew that there were some companies whose stock I'd rather own than others. And I knew that I would rather, like, own stock than own bonds because I thought technology was gonna be worth a lot more. I have different ideas today about the next ten or twenty years, but I think it's good. It's not only okay. It's good to have strong ideas about the future. And it is okay to not be super diversified in your investment portfolio or your career or your life. And then the final question is if you could leave young people who wanna have a big impact with one or two pieces of advice, what would you tell them? Well, I I don't wanna give people a specific field to go work on because I think the whole idea is that people need to figure out themselves what they believe in and what they think and what they believe is high impact to work on for the future. So what I will say instead is it is really important to actually think hard about where you think you can make the biggest contribution And then go meet people to work with. Go learn as much about that field as you can. And then have the the courage of your convictions to actually take a risk and focus on it and and go do something there, and that it's okay if you fail. And if you do fail, you'll not be in much different of a place than you are today, and you can go try the next thing. But it it I think really important to be willing to go take a risk and make some amount of sacrifice to be able to try to impact the world in in some way that that you really care about. And
