Unknown: for first interview in a very long time. So I wanna start with OpenAI because OpenAI was founded in part out of a fear that artificial general intelligence or sort of superhuman intelligence
Sam Altman: AI is that it will take, it'll help us be our best. It'll help us, like, amplify our best and stop our our worst impulses. flaws. We have deep inequities in the world. And I think that AI is going to be a way where we can decide what's good and make sure the AI honors that and keeps that and that fundamental. Because there's a lot of good in us as well. And the
Unknown: the injustices, I think we'll be able to address. Elon Musk, founded this with you, has been concerned about the sort of apocalyptic possible future of AI.
Sam Altman: I think it's always hard to say, like, when you had any incredibly powerful new technology, here's exactly how it's going to go. I will say that I am personally optimistic And, one thing that I've become more confident about is that that's not going to happen. And the reason is that this requires truly massive compute resources, you know, giant data centers, custom build chips. And so I think there will be we'll know all the projects in the world working on it. Some will be government, some will be private, some will be like us. But my hope is that as we get closer and closer, those projects will come together and make sure that we're thinking about the safety and the control issues. In looking towards the future, there's some concern that artificial intelligence research and development has hit a wall and that we need a radically different approach to achieve the breakthroughs that we were hoping for. Would you agree with that? Not at all. I think if you look at the landmark result in the field each year for the past, say, four years, it's incredibly more impressive every year. You know, it wasn't that long ago we couldn't even beat Go with AI. And now we can beat incredibly sophisticated video games with hundreds of thousands of actions taken with thousands of options at each step. And we have made algorithmic progress each year. We've also made incredible hardware progress. You know, every year we can use 10 times more compute power per deep learning model. So it's just the rate of progress is incredible, and that's gonna continue. basically, every two weeks, our bot has like a 90% win rate against the bot from two weeks ago. So the rate of improvement there is just unbelievable. So what's underhyped people talk about sort of self driving trucks and the impact that's going to have on jobs, and that's true. But what they don't talk about is all of the white collar work that AI is going to do. My belief is that all repetitive human work that doesn't require the deep emotional connection between two people, that will all be done in the next couple of decades better, cheaper, faster by AI. Some robots will eat some jobs and some robots will kill humans. You've already seen that with self driving cars. but I believe that I think it takes like unique human arrogance to believe that, opportunity that comes along only every couple of centuries to redo the socioeconomic contract And how we include everybody in that and make everybody a winner, you know, shared some controversial thoughts about universal basic income. How is the the work you're seeing in AI impacting your view of social inequality? Well, one is that I think the social inequality we have today is nothing compared to what we could have if we don't address it because AI will just be such a powerful lever. Two is that I think we do have an opportunity as we rewrite the social contract to think about, how we can get towards a more equal world. We'll never get all the way there, But then how do we make everyone happy and fulfilled and find their purpose?
Unknown: Whether when it comes to, you know, the value of startups that are being created, the valuation of the startups that are being created, and whether it's worth it. You know, I made this, like, public bet
Sam Altman: It is everyone's now operating back to operating mode where, like, everything's great, everything's gonna keep going up. So I'm much more nervous than I was when I made that post. I think it was, like, three and a half years ago. I try not to get too focused on bubbles because I try to keep this multi decade view. over the decades of compounding it takes to create a super valuable company. However, one trend that we're seeing that's I think affecting all start ups now, at least in the Bay Area, is, the competition for talent with the tech hyper caps is very difficult. So, you know, when you have Google or Facebook finding the best engineers and putting these incredibly hopefully very soon before deciding about my continued involvement in the board. In general, I believe you should always wait for the data to make any sort of decision, any sort of comment, but this case seemed to be exceptional. We seem to be entering a prolonged period of tech
Unknown: hating after coming out of a period of tech adulation Yeah. Praise.
Sam Altman: I don't know. I I feel this is also well outside of my area of expertise. I generally believe you can you should believe people when they're upset, but not always about why. Because I think it's hard to articulate, like, exactly why aren't people mad at the tech companies. But I think I think it's like a deeply American value to be suspicious of huge concentrated power and wealth. unassailable, and yet they always there's always The next Facebook and Google will not look like Facebook and Google in the same way that Facebook and Google didn't look like Intel and Microsoft. I will say one thing about the new generation of companies that I've noticed is that they are more thoughtful at the beginning about the impact that their companies will have if they're wildly successful on the world and people's lives than I think the companies from ten or fifteen years ago were. And I think that's part of growing up in this current environment. Yeah. I'm happy about that.
