Unknown: So I want to transition now. You're gonna hear more about all these topics from us after the break. Some people say we might be living in an AI bubble because companies at scale like T Mobile haven't figured out how to unlock value from it for customers and for our business models. And so today, we announced a unique partnership with OpenAI to create a new kind of engagement model for customers. And this is with the intention of not just slapping on AI to some existing business processes, but actually changing those business processes profoundly And in order to help you understand that, I'd like to have a conversation about it with none other than the CEO of OpenAI and our friend and partner, Sam Altman. Please welcome Sam.
Sam Altman: The GPT series of models was amazing at sort of of these new kind of reasoning models. And metrics for in our launch blog post. It's a very significant step forward. And I think So I think we're that early with o one. There will be totally new ways to use it that are not just a chat interface. The second which we've just reached now is reasoners. The third is agents. The fourth is sort of innovators, ability to figure out new scientific information. And the fifth is full organizations. So this move from one to two took a while but I think the most exciting one of the most exciting things about two that it enables level three relatively quickly after. And the agentic experiences that we expect
Unknown: That real thinking has to be done inside companies as to how to apply these. You know, thinking about the data state, the business processes themselves in order to show that these transformative technologies, maybe the most transformative in our lifetime, can actually translate to business value at scale.
Sam Altman: The spirit of T Mobile as innovative improving the sort of customer experience and sort of what this can mean for totally reimagining how customer support works.
Unknown: by really examining the pools of data that are available to get the AI to be able to not just inform our agents like we've been doing with other partners, but to deeply understand
Sam Altman: for an individual user or customer, and also what we can do for integration these hopefully fairly magical experiences. And so, and this personalization integration coming together, I We can dream up pretty far about what it's going to be like for a customer
Unknown: a finite number of treatments that make sense versus what this is able to do is more human like. Right? Listen to the customer's actual and then choose a treatment based on massive pools of data that will optimize their success journey with t mobile. And so, it's not about finite set of intentions and it's not about a finite set of treatments because it's it's examining in the background and eventually in real time massive pools of data. And the good news is it can be inspired by millions and millions of both success and failure cases from prior interactions generated by AIs or humans. Yeah. I think this will be one of these We said in our goal that we wanted to see a 75% reduction in calls offered. That means not just intercepting those with a faster, better AI, but also preventing problems. And we can use OpenAI to really understand these models are just so good at making sense of lots of data. So we can Can we talk about data safety? Yeah. You know, one of the questions I know people will have is, alright, so how's this gonna work? I mean, you know, are customers giving their permission for us to do all this stuff and and how you know, in that sense, what we're doing isn't much different than how we're already operating which is to use your data at T Mobile to make your T Mobile experience better. But we're getting now OpenAI deeply involved.
Sam Altman: Can you talk about data safety? How is this data not gonna escape t mobile and used to train the wider models and So I think one thing that is not well understood by OpenAI is that we don't train our models on API customer data. So like that is your data, other customers data, that's their data. We can do custom models for you with that data or we can do, We build on a gigantic amount of work that has come before us and you know, the field of AI is an old field that people have been contributing really brilliant ideas to for a long time. And more than that, we If if you think about all of the work that had to happen in throughout human history to discover semiconductors and build chips and networks and these massive data centers, we're just doing our one little little bit on the very top of that. we try to do it as well as we can and we try to have a very focused research program. I think one of the mistakes that other research programs make is they don't have enough conviction and a concentration. It's very easy to copy something once it works. So I think the two ways you can succeed are say, we're gonna be a great fast follower and we're gonna like just copy whatever OpenAI does or whatever somebody else does that works and I don't mean that as negative as it came across because I think there are a lot of companies that just wait to see what works and then do a very good job of polishing execution. But, if you're trying to move the frontier, that's that's
Unknown: kind of a pattern that OpenAI is you know, now pursuing which is doubling down in a few areas. You know, we're your benchmark partner when it comes to unlocking the value of all this in industry. But I know you're interested in other areas as well. And since we have a couple of spare minutes, can you talk about what you're excited about? I know you're doing amazing more verticalized things not just with us but you're interested healthcare,
Sam Altman: Healthcare is an area as you mentioned where I would expect greatness. I I think, you know, most of the world unfortunately does not get access to great healthcare and what these models can do for that. I'm really excited to see someone go build the best imaginable AI medical advisor and make that broadly available. I think that that'll be a big step forward. Education's another area where we're seeing great stuff happen already today. Watching what people have done. I think o one has only been out for like five days or something. Six days maybe. Watching what people have been doing with it is is is really remarkable. And what people used to do with GPT four also was pretty good. But if you imagine every student getting personalized tutoring best for them along with the rest of their educational experience, An area that I am extremely personally excited for that I think is still in the future but we can now see glimpses of it. Is AI helping us accelerate scientific discovery? I believe that most of the real sustainable economic growth in the world, life getting better for all of us, that comes
Unknown: a minute ago, you said that you're building on a thousand years of capabilities and just doing a tiny little bit of work on top and that might be one of the most humble things I've ever heard anybody say. You're amazing, what you're doing is amazing. Just thank you for the inspiration and thanks for this partnership that I think has a huge opportunity to unlock at scale
