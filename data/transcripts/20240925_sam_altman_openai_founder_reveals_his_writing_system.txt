Unknown: what he's gonna actually work on, how he chose to focus on AGI? Well, those are the things that we talk about in this episode, and we get answers. Let's get into the conversation with Sam Altman. Alright, Sam. I wanna begin with how has knowledge of LLMs changed how you think about writing and communication?
Sam Altman: tool to write in a new way, where you have this thing that is not, you know, expanding your bullet points, but is helping you discover new things in the idea space. And, that's awesome. Like, that's what computers do at their best. Right? Is they they help they are a tool that help you do things you otherwise couldn't do.
Unknown: I don't we can for sure make it better, but I understand why that's where we are. Tell me if this is baseless or accurate or where on the spectrum it is, but I find it interesting that there's a juxtaposition between words being more important on the input, and then moving away from words with the output. So, DALL E. I think words are gonna be a huge part of how we
Sam Altman: communicate with computers, how we program computers. And natural language is kind of the interface to computers that people want, I think. I think that's been you know, sci fi predicted that for a long time. But I think a big part of the revolution of ChatGPT was you could just talk to a computer in plain English and get it to do all these things. It won't be the only way we wanna interact with computers, of course. And you'll have multimodal input as well as output, but we are very finely evolved to use language. to imagine humanity and human culture without language, it's like, seems imposs I can't do it. I don't think we know yet what the writing of the future, That's not why people really write in the first place. Like, the kind of writing that you can just the kind of thing you would do by having Chatziubiti go write your your kind of, you know, essay for English class. That's not real. That's not what this is about anyway. And if ChatGee Bute can help people do do a writing like activity and get higher quality thinking out of it, that's wonderful. Tell me about that. Literally, if if we believe that part of the value a big part of the value of writing is to clarify your own thinking, and we can have new tools that help you do that better than before, that'll be a big win. I I I you know, I try to, like, watch people. Like, very different walks of life use ChatGPT, and it's always illuminating. So I watched two students use it to kind of, like, help with their homework, do their homework, to be honest, recently. And one of them basically just, like, put in their thing and wrote their whole essay, and I was, like, appalled because I kind of knew that that was a theoretical thing that people were doing at, you know, significant volume or whatever. But you hear about it. But, like, to, like, watch someone just, like, do that and then get an essay that was, you know, bad, but, like, passable out of it was like, that was, like, a real, like, what have we done moment. It was like visceral in a way that, you know, I just hadn't I'd never seen someone do it before. And then, I watched someone else use it in a in a very different, more interactive way to try to do something more like what you're talking about, which is like, I have this idea. I can't quite articulate it. I'm kind of stuck. Let me get unblocked and let me generate a bunch more ideas. And the thing that came out of that was far better than I think anybody would have done on their own. And I was, like, reflecting a lot on that, and the first question was, like, a bad question. Like, if you can just put something in and get a super interesting or that I thought not like, I I a super passable response. I I think we're just, like, asking people to do the wrong thing. Whereas, if it's something that, like, gets them to want to think about a question differently and use the tool to help them get somewhere they wouldn't have gotten on their own, that's really interesting. And both ChatGPT has gotten better, I figured out to use it more. And so the cool thing now is I really do use it as a general purpose tool. And I hope that a few years from now when you asked that, I'll say I use it for most things that I do. Like, every few months I find new ways to use it, new ways to incorporate. It's it's obviously still terribly integrated into most people's workflows, but that's just gonna get better and better. I mean, the thing that I hear about from my friends that they love it for the most is, like, computer programming, help in some way or other, and the number of people who say that's, like, transformed my life. Yeah. I mean, like, it's very gratifying to hear. It's a lot of fun. Like, there there are other things where, you know, people say it's, like, changed the way my kids learn, or teachers say change the way I teach us. That's great too. And But I and then there's, like, incredible examples with health care, the way people use this for creative work. But the programming one is, like, near and dear to my heart. Many of my friends are programmers, so I hear about that a lot. I do a lot of, like, very short email. Like, I do a lot of, like, seven word emails. And how has ChatGPT helped you with that? It's super good at summarizing long emails that like, most long emails, honestly, I just stop. I don't even read. But if I have to read one, it's super good at, like, ChatGPT's ability to effectively summarize long pieces of content, there's a really interesting thing there, which is that, at some sense it took me, like, years to really understand this, but Ilya would always say that what these models are really about is compression. And we're gonna go figure out how to compress as much knowledge as possible, and that's how we're gonna make AI. Compression is like the secret to intelligence. And that was like, I had to meditate on that for a long time, and I'm sure I still don't fully understand it. But
Unknown: I thought it was really interesting in your conversation with Joe Hudson, how you spoke about the way that you've released anxiety from your life. How has that change in your internal state shown up in your thinking?
Sam Altman: And I think there is something about the world that has gone horribly wrong there. And I'm sure having like background anxiety running as a process makes it harder to think that might be an interesting idea, but I would, like, feel embarrassed or foolish to even, like, tell people that I was thinking about it or working on it. Like, if if you can't even let yourself, like, go pretty far down the path of exploring an idea before you worry about what other people are gonna think about it, that seems bad. often see people who I think are really talented, work super hard, are super productive, I write for my write things down for myself or for the most, and for, like, private groups the second most, and public at this point very rarely. What are the different parameters of clear communication? There's sort of the sloganeering. not so hard. But getting clear about the actual ideas is really hard. And so I think unclear communication is is a symptom of unfocused thinking for the most part. Napoleon, But I also think that's like borne out in business. That clarity, speed, quality of execution all linked. Writing is not my gift, and I'm okay with that. Like, writing is super valuable to me as a tool for thinking, for communicating with internally with the org, but there's nothing helping startup founders and for getting to invest in good startup founders. So I wanted to get I wanted to, like, try to get good at it. I I'm, like, I'm not a naturally gifted writer, but I believe, like, you know, with practice, anybody people can get good at a lot of things. I wanted to, like, kind of continue doing the thing that seemed to work so well for YC, getting good founders. But, honestly, it wasn't it's not my calling in life. I don't really do it anymore. You wanted to be a novelist. That astounded me. I am still very happy at the experiment because I learned that I can, like, write for myself to clarify my own thinking, and that has been super powerful. Even the ability to, like, write a message to, like, explain to a team what a plan is and why we're gonna do it, I think doing that in writing versus doing that in a meeting is often very powerful. Have you done that recently? It's like if we're starting a new project or if we're putting together some sort of, like, plan that we're gonna execute on, forcing myself to write it down rather than just, like, sit in a meeting and let it spitball around has been very good. Do you have a format of sorts?
Unknown: Tell me about your just communication lessons that you've learned from Peter Thiel. He is so
Sam Altman: And one thing that he does super well is he comes up with these, And, I don't know I don't know how to do that. Don't really know anybody else who does that like he does, but it's a he has, like, very interesting things to say and very interesting ways to say them. And most people, you're lucky to get one or the other. He is, like, a very rare combination of both. It's super impressive. What do you think contributes to that? He thinks about the world in this sort of, like, way he has you know, I mean, the first thing anybody would say about him is he is a truly brilliant original thinker, and that's just rare. There's a boundlessness about your thinking that really stands out. here is a totally different view on something that no one else has ever expressed and now sounds like obviously at least interesting and often obviously correct. can we just do more? Like, we have this like vector. to tie it back to Peter, And that is the kind of mistake I try not to make. So I'm like a big believer in find what is working and like go aggressively after it.
Unknown: Ideas are such a power law, and it's about finding that core thing and just doubling, tripling down on that.
Sam Altman: And when you find one, you should quadruple down on it, and it should be the only thing you push on. You know, you should only push on a few of these things. In writing, in business, whatever, I I I really I really, really believe in this principle. And, I mean, I think this is why, like, all business almost all business books are terrible. Right? There's, like, three good ideas in 300 pages. And what a reader wants is three good ideas in one page. Yeah. Did Paul Graham teach you anything specifically about writing? Yeah. Mostly just by reading his essays. I think like many other people, my introduction to the startup world and excitement about it came from reading PG's essays. He's like an unbelievable writer, and that was a topic of, like, great interest to me and many other people. I think a whole generation of us, like, copied PG in all of these ways. And so, although he was never like, let me teach you a class on how to write, it's like, they're both business writing, but other than that, they're like different species. Again, I think of, like, writing as a tool to think more clearly or to get to the essence of something. And then, hopefully, when you're in a pitch meeting for your startup or whatever, you've already figured out how to get that down to the clear essence of it. And if you can it's really dramatically different to be on the other side of a pitch if the person has, like, gotten their thinking clear ahead of time or not. exceptionally clear thinkers and horrible communicators, but it's rare. Like, I had to sit here earlier as you were talking about that and think. And so, if someone can get their thinking clear before a pitch, then they can get across to you what they're trying to do. And there are a lot of people who can do this without writing, but I often find that writing is is really is really helpful. Since ChatGeeBT launched, all of, like, the normal hobbies of life pretty much What's the next step, or tell me where I'm wrong? And you can do, like, a lot of that over dinner parties and make a lot of progress. You know, you can, like, host friends for a weekend and talk about something a lot and make a lot of progress. But there is something about the process of trying to crystallize it onto a sheet of favor that has to be, like, internally consistent that doesn't let you, like, hide from the weak points. I I Not for everything, but I like that. I personally think that's, like, maybe too constraining for some important ideas, even though I directionally super agree with you that, like, short is short is critical. How much of your own writing the inspiration is born from conversation? A lot. But but but it it kind of, like, comes in as this jumble of ideas, and then writing is helpful because it you know, I I I think of, like, conversation as this very generative process, and then you've gotta, like, grind it down to the essence, and that is best done, like, sitting in front of a big monitor with no one else around. than than untangling something. Because it's more like a process of like removing than untangling. Can you recommend me a book to read? And I kind of think about it and say, no, not really. So I think I would try to like write the book for the people that ask what they should read about AI. And I think I would start with like, here is the historical context of other technological revolutions, why this one will be similar, why it'll be different. Here's how the technology actually works. Here's what is possible Like, I just I I actually wrote something that I may do as a blog post, but it's like super long. It's like 20 pages. It's way too long, and I may just not have time to edit it down, but it was still interesting to write. But, like, for something like that, I still, you know, capitalize it perfectly. So, it's like still in there somewhere. The biggest thing that you that I took away most of the time is did not run the company in a clear way, did not explain to the team what they were doing, did not explain to investors, to customers everything else that they were doing in a clear way. And that is a very hard way to have a chance at success for a company. So much of your job as a founder or anyone leading any kind of company is evangelist without clear communication. I think getting the knowledge out about how to do startups is just like a clear net win for the world. It's not the most important part of what YC does, like the one on one mentoring support, the network, that's all more important. But putting the knowledge out there is is, I think, a good and easy thing to do. And what is something that you learned while running YC that you feel like really influences the way that you run OpenAI? A big part of YC was just, like, encouraging founders to be more ambitious and to, like, kinda go after what they believed in. And I think there's a lot of that in the too. The thing that I have been thinking about is how can I use Try GPT to just, like, make writing feel higher volume and lower stakes? Like, how I still like, if I have to go write, like, a 10 page thing, that still feels like a huge thing to have to go do. And if if if using GPT continue to do that? Well, future versions of GPT will be very capable of that. What the fair thing to Tyler Cowen is in that case, we're trying to figure out. But for sure, what everybody agrees on is there there can be many personalities that are not based on real people, you can have let's call them, like, personas. Can have, like, Chattypeauty remix things in different personas. I think that'll be helpful in the creative process. The thing that I hope for more than anything else out of ChatGPT and future versions is that it will be a tool that lets us do things we just couldn't do before, think of ideas we just couldn't have before, be more creative than we could be before. And this is kind of the arc of technology, but I think this is gonna be a particularly great example of it. but I do know people are gonna get very good at using the tool like they do with any new tool, and that will expand the realm of human possibility.
Unknown: One of the things that I really admire about you is how deliberate you are about thinking about what to work on. And I'm curious how you thought about your choice to work on AGI and what that process of envisioning that one thing that you're gonna focus on was all about.
Sam Altman: at the now working on AGI seems like the obvious only decision for me at least. But at the time, it seemed like a pipe dream. ideas the best ideas are extremely fragile, and there is an unbelievable amount of value in figuring out a setup, a method, whatever you wanna call it, for not killing very fragile but potentially very great ideas. This comes down to, like, how you think about it, what your process to make a decision is. It comes down to, like, who you surround yourself with. But I think in the the very early days, the main thing is not to accidentally kill good ideas. So tell me about fragility and how writing factors into this. The thing that is most important to me, personally, about writing is, like, externalized thinking and organization, magnification, whatever you want to call it, of clarify
Unknown: in the early days of OpenAI in terms of focusing on this, what was the sort of final output of that process where you said, let's do it? I do remember intermediate stages where it was like, talk to, like, a bunch of people,
Sam Altman: You would write some of those down, and it would be like, very obvious to you immediately. it's gonna be an organization, I don't do this with, like, as much rigor as I should. It hasn't been annual, but maybe, like, every two years. I've written a document for OpenAI called literally Our Plan. Nice. And the first one was, like, 25 pages, Every weekend. I mean, every weekend, I'll, like, write something and usually share it with, like, 10 people internally or something. Just like, here's the thing I've been thinking about that we should do. Yeah. I have been working on something I actually plan to publish, which is rare for me now, about just sort of If I just can't figure out how to phrase something or I'm, like, struggling with something or, like, just can't get something to flow. But it's definitely not, like, gonna replace coming up with the ideas anytime soon. It's an incredible tool for writers. Like, incredible tool for writers, but definitely not a writer. your novel, and people would come in with all of the standard, like, freshman and college mistakes, like, you know, way too many, like, stretched metaphors, way too much, like, flowery language. And then she'd go through this, like, exercise of, I think, a standard one first, which is cut one metaphor from every page. Cut one unnecessary and the answer was there was, like, no story at all. There was the the instinct was try to, like, write this, like, beautifully whatever kind of satisfying to write thing, but it's no fun to read. Like, the readers want a story. Yeah. And the thing from this, like, teacher is that we might teach people to write beautifully, but there's there's no interesting story. On the other hand, you have these, like, sort of massively mass market successful, But if the model just gets a lot smarter
Unknown: When you're sitting down to write and you're thinking about creating
Sam Altman: I mean, if I do have, like, if I had, like, a perfect thing, would be, like, you know, Saturday morning with a cup of coffee and nothing scheduled.
Unknown: I take it, and I ask it to just clean it up. And I find ChatGPT to be so helpful with that because I'm much more generative with my mouth than I am with my fingertips.
Sam Altman: I'm convinced there's ideas I would never have sitting and talking with people that I just need to sit and type for. This is, like, obviously a very common observation, but but figuring out, like, the right amount of being with people, talking, you know, getting exposed to, like, a lot of ideas, and then having some time alone to think, to write, to just sort of, like, do some deep work, whatever that is, I think, obviously, this is a super important pattern to a lot of people, definitely to me. My sort of, like, roughly rough rhythm is I'm, like, you know, in the office kinda nonstop all week. I have no time to think. It's just, like, kinda crazy packed. And then on the weekends, I have, like, long quiet blocks, and I'm not really around people. micro point five pen is the best pen overall, but the Muji point three
Unknown: competence with the written word is going up so much. And here's what I mean. There's now you know, with Sora, you can create videos
Sam Altman: full stop. And we have much bigger issues to worry about at that point.
