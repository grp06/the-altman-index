Reid Hoffman: It's not just a, hey, you invent and a ton of talent here and the venture capital stuff all works. in the Valley all say network effects as something super important. do this, is occasionally when I'm feeling impish,
Sam Altman: really why we started our own growth stage fund. And so for us, get to the most promising new founders at the very start of their career thinking about a startup, get the best ones of those into our program, build a program with real network effects, and then have this continuity fund to help invest in these companies and teach them to scale.
Reid Hoffman: too much of the advice that's given to entrepreneurs is, for example, when you're 20 people, hire your scale executives so that when you're at thousands and so forth, have all those people baked in place. And very rarely are the right people when you're executives at 20 or 50 are the right people for executives when you're a thousand or 500. and that you need to be anticipating that you're refactoring your org. You need to be anticipating that for example, you're looking at your set of folks.
Sam Altman: you know, we just had our second major reorg in two years. And I read that as, oh, they're saying we're not moving fast enough. And they meant it as way too chaotic. And it it's this and I stand by my read of it. But I think like the the amount of dynamism that the startups that really scale well have always looks a little chaotic on the outside. It's just because there's constant shuffling of new people in and people who aren't working out, out. The very best founders that we've worked with,
Reid Hoffman: there will be chaos. We're trying to constantly manage it, but we don't manage to zero chaos until we're actually in a relatively stable place. And so expect that, work collaboratively was optimizing for that. a host. So this is actually part of when I got to PayPal and was kind of when Peter and Max and I were going on walks about how to first build what was first called FieldLink, then Confinity, then PayVal.
Sam Altman: But unfortunately it's usually like twenty years of the exact same year of experience over and over again and they probably can't learn and adapt Speaking of YC continuity, Ollie who runs our continuity fund had never had any venture job before and has done a fabulous job. you free yourself from the sort of the traditional model of how you hire executives in a non growing, very static company and think that in a blitzscaling company you have to flip the the priority of skills, you end up or the priority of attributes, you end up with a very different team, but it's the one that works. And the very best companies take this exceptionally far in
Reid Hoffman: a non traditionally qualified executive. Yes, and actually, I mean there's a bunch of different parts of hacks on this. One of things that I actually learned from when Sean Parker and Zuckerberg hired Kohler from LinkedIn, most need to solve and then getting the generalist into it. Because one of the things that you do need to eventually, as you scale, hire specialists, but the theme that you look at as you move from startup to scale up is you always have generalists. The generalists are important for learning, changing the organization, adapting, adapting product market fit, tackling new markets, going global, etcetera. But you still very selectively add in the specialists. where I asked him, I said, look, there's two theories of thought in Silicon Valley. One theory is that culture eats strategy, and that culture is the dependent thing for how you really build great companies. And then the other theory is that actually culture is the historical explanation for successful companies. Right? That when you have a successful company, you look back and say that culture, that was really great. that, again, when you look at the traits of you're gonna be reorganizing fairly consistently. And as you reorganize, especially managerial roles, that resets a bunch of patterns and you'll have some chaos in that. How do you keep a high performing, very strong company? And culture is in part the answer to that. Because if your only culture is top down hierarchy and messaging and communications that comes from the top, And cultures are not like there is the good culture and the bad culture. Cultures are defined by an organization. Some cultures are engineering cultures. Some cultures are high IQ cultures. Some cultures are collaborative teamwork cultures. The problem is that it doesn't just end there. You actually do have to play good strategy and everything else. So the thing that when people frequently sell culture too much is they say once you have good culture, everything else follows because you hire the right people, you play the right way together. And that's of course extremely important, but if you don't get the business model and the strategy right. How do you guys teach culture at YC? What's the particular
Sam Altman: So they really do somehow have to fit together. The the general framework that I think about when building when adding people to a team, which is I think what defines culture, is what what is going to be this person's net effect on the output vector of the organization? moderately intelligent and moderately productive but have a hugely positive impact on what they get everybody else to do. And I think like one version of culture is Which screens out sort of just looking at people in a vacuum. I think though that it's really easy to sort of use that matters I think to the best people is one where they can just come and be really productive and be around really other great people. And if you have a culture which is which looks good on the surface but somehow rejects super talented people or is just it's covering up for constant infighting, Everyone wants looked once at the average tenure of employees at companies in San Francisco get lower. And so you know this idea of how important it is to have people that are going to join a company and stay there for five or ten years sounds like a crazy thing to say because no one does that anymore. which one of the things that is included in that is wild success for the company and the mission that people care about. That's really important. But but getting people who are there for that and not there for the green tea,
Reid Hoffman: super important for this is actually, in fact, I think too few organizations following what Hastings did in terms of creating a culture deck. Now the thing that's interesting is that the
Sam Altman: value statements and culture decks and the problem is
Reid Hoffman: Because part of the way that they try to help the culture say is they say they're doing that check. Matter of fact, Neil Bushry, when I was talking to this, I think he and Dave Duffield interviewed everybody up to 500 because they were the final culture interview. They presumed that everyone had done the skills and other kinds of things, they were the are you the right fit? And that's super important. But your hiring changes as you scale. That the process, again, what got you here doesn't get you there because now you need to start hiring a bunch more people. You need to be trusting people in the rest of your organization to hire well. You need to be systematizing more. Like one thing is you begin to get from the, call it, the hundreds into early hundreds and the late hundreds, you'll actually start having onboarding classes. Like when you say, okay, we hire people, and then all 15 people start at the same day so that we train them on our company I'm gonna shift topics to communications within the company. Classically, when you're at an early stage, communications pattern, but it's the kind of communications pattern that shows you. Like when she started at Google, used to be special, it used to be personal, It used to be kind of closely connected. And now, it's not so special anymore. And so that's the kind of thing when you're planning for dynamism. The same thing isn't true in terms of corporate communications. certain key risks, executive decisions that not everyone's going know, and you have to condition to this is still a great place even as that's changing, and then also the structure of those communications.
Sam Altman: He used to spend or still does spend like 20 of his 30 nights a month taking key Airbnb employees that don't report him out to dinner.
Reid Hoffman: The other key thing is to decide when you really need to hit the gas because part of what the blitzscaling stuff is, you actually deploy capital in a fast and inefficient way in order to get to scale and or global scale. And sometimes that's competition, sometimes that's market opportunity, sometimes that's critical mass density and networks. But one of the key things is what are the different judgment points at which you're hitting the accelerator on scale
Sam Altman: hire reasonably slowly? Or are we in the mode where we got things to work and we know what to do and we are now going to like spend money at an unreasonable rate almost no company or to explain the company's mission, almost no company can do that hyper scale mode or not?
Reid Hoffman: Another is the question, generally speaking, changes of mission are really bad, so the mission should also be there. So to some degree everyone is we're in service of the mission, not we have this role in a specific organization. And then generally speaking, changes to strategy are very expensive. They frequently happen, pivots, etcetera. What tends to not be as much as is like, okay,
Sam Altman: People like delighting customers. People like it if there's just this like mass demand and this huge upward draft behind what you're doing. One of the reasons I think why trying to hyperscale a company that is not that is not winning fails is because without that, then all of these problems of people having their turf stepped on and you know the occasional bad hire you have to get out, people have a lot of time to like think about how unhappy those things make them. And if things just keep getting better and there's like more opportunity than you can possibly take on and that everyone constantly has like new expanding roles and so they don't get caught up in these turf wars, then it works. But I think this is one of the reasons it's so important to not flip into hyperscaling mode until you're pretty sure the product is working. Because without without this natural updraft of like a market that is desperate for your product and a feeling that like everyone is winning every day and the company is doing just fantastically well,
Reid Hoffman: business where you're actually in fact working on efficiency. All companies ultimately get back to that in some way. Now you can have such a geyser of money that you can have many parts of your company that focused on operating margins and how costs work and how scale works and everything else in a capital efficient model, but not yet. And frequently, one of the questions that can be in consumer Internet especially, enterprise needs to identify this earlier than consumer. Consumers sometimes will overly obsess with operating margins early when it's actually in fact get to scale, then obsessed with operating margins. Because if you're not at scale, your operating margins don't matter,
