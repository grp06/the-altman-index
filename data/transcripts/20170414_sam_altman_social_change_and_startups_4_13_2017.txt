Sam Altman: And that sounds very simple, but in practice, it has turned out to be a much harder and more interesting job than than I ever thought. We basically have a platform where we can identify very talented people from around the world or try to. We have tens of thousands of them apply to our program every year that have an idea for a company and companies twice a year. And these are very early stage companies. They're certainly almost always at the stage where it sounds like a terrible idea. And we try to help them get going. We try to build a community so that they have peers and founders and advisors, the partners that work at Y Combinator. Give We them a little bit of money, a lot of advice. We work with them very intensively for the first three months of their company's life. But then we go on forever. We still work with companies that we funded ten, twelve years ago. And we have been able to fund enough companies that we've now created a sort of a network. And so helping them with whatever they need help with. Right. And this can be really different. So I was Boom is a company that we funded recently trying to make supersonic airplanes. And I I was out visiting them yesterday. And their problems are not problems like I've had help with before. You know, it's the FAA is I was talking to more recent companies that we funded that are just trying to like find any user to use their product. You know, will someone please care what I'm doing? How do I find that person? You know? So there's a hugely broad range of companies that we work with. We don't have any particular industry unless the challenges that every company faces A lot of it is also meeting new entrepreneurs and hearing about new ideas. And then I try to spend a lot of time just learning about new technology and trying to understand the world. The most important thing we do is pick good founders and good ideas. Last year, what is the new technology wave that's going to drive the next big cluster of companies in the same way that after we got smartphones in the next few years, we got Uber, Snapchat, like, learning to type learning QBasic. And that doesn't make you too popular. But I liked it. I had fun. And it was just like, I think like many other people who got into programming at a young age, it felt like magic. You know, I can type these characters that really made me fall in love with tech. You know, like, the two things I was really into in high school were computers and and cars. And that hasn't changed much. And and I think this idea that we can like, it wasn't that long ago that we were like that humans were digging stuff out of the ground. And we had nothing. We had no tools. We had nothing. And if you just think about kind of the way we've bootstrapped up to this world now where we can create these amazing technologies from from from nothing not that long ago, And I had started investing And I I turned out to really like helping founders. You And I turned and I stayed really close to Y Combinator because I felt like something important was happening. It was this community that I had become part of and that I wanted to give back to. And and I and I had become convinced that startups were going to be this secular shift in the world to how things got done and that the the world had changed in this fundamental way with just the drastically lowered cost of starting a company that a lot of people would be able to do amazing things with startups. And I didn't think it was going to be just software. And so I started getting interested in biotech companies, in in nuclear fusion companies, supersonic airplane companies, rocket companies. And I I thought that this same model of start with low amounts of capital, iterate super quickly, and have laser focus on building a great product was going to work. And so I got progressively more involved with Y Combinator. I had been investing more. I had I had raised a fund and kind of scaled that up. And I started talking to Paul Graham, who founded the organization for almost two years about taking it over. I think it's always tempting to learn too many lessons from failure and not enough from success. So I did learn all of these things. I don't know how much they help. I mean, one thing that I learned that really matters is you can't you can't create a market that doesn't want to exist. And I think we did a lot of things really well, but we had this one catastrophic problem, which is that we and a lot of other people thought there was going to be this movement to people using location And I I try to use my capital for the things that I think are really important to a good future, that if I don't invest in them, they won't happen. To what companies? Well, Cruise was one. I I I think I think self driving cars, although they have some very negative societal impacts, are going to help solve the housing crisis. I think they will lead to drastically fewer deaths. And this was a company people people always retell the story. Cruise, you know, such a hot company, was gonna be so successful. They couldn't raise money. I sort of invested because I believed in them and the founder, and they couldn't raise money. Didn't want to see them shut down. And he did it. And so he went from nothing at the beginning of the program to an Audi I think it was an s four and a four, one of those two, that he had, like, taken all of the plastic coverings off of, put servos into the steering column and onto the pedals, like hooked up a camera on top of the car, and had a car ten weeks to the day or whatever after he started that drove itself to YC. And I was like, well, I didn't think that was gonna happen. and about why what he was doing, the car companies weren't going to do, Google wasn't going to do. But I was really impressed. But, you know, He Helion is a nuclear fusion company that I have invested a lot in and and and one I really believe in. I think if you could pick one thing to hugely impact the quality of life of a lot of people, getting government program is. businesses used to do these amazing things. I want anyone to do fusion. If you could just, like, snap your fingers and pick one thing, I think that would be transformative and and super important to so many other problems. The energy just energy is a factor for so many other problems that I I think people don't even understand. we can have better transportation to help alleviate the housing crisis. So I but I try to pick companies like that that I think I understand well, I can help. And if I don't invest, maybe they won't happen. I wanna talk about But for every time, you know, investors sit around and say, we think mobile is gonna be the next big thing, you you forget about all the times they say, it's definitely podcasting. It's definitely Facebook apps. So I think it's really important to try to think as independently as you can and not chase the trend, unless it's one of these, like, absolute mega waves that is going to spawn a ton of companies. My candidate for that, so I don't give a total non answer, is I think machine learning applied to every vertical is the easiest layup in all of startups right now. I think you can take this idea and apply it, you know, like farming, self driving cars, radiology. And I think there is a massive company to be a new massive company to be built in every every vertical. is one. I think even if we don't make any more research progress on machine learning, which we will, but even if we don't, and you just take what already works today, what, you know, the papers that have been released in the last year, there are a $100,000,000,000 companies waiting to be started just with what we already have working. The the world is really different than it was two years ago there. Yeah. I mean, leads me to I think the most interesting thing that you guys are doing right now, So before I say it, I don't think this is the only answer. I don't think universal basic income is the cure to all societal ills in the way that some people do. But I think that we are about to see a change in the economy on the order of the Industrial Revolution or the Agricultural Revolution, where you see a huge amount of human jobs change in a very short period of time. And we'll find new jobs on the other side. I think human demand is limitless. who know? I mean, we're all artists. I doubt that. I think it'd be something we don't think of today. But there will be some new jobs on the other side. In the meantime, we're going to have a real disruption. And I think for all the people talking about how machine learning technology is going to eliminate jobs, there aren't that many talking about what what do we as the tech industry do to solve the problem that we're helping to create. So what are you doing in Oakland? So one idea is that at a minimum this won't be the whole solution, but as a minimum, we should create a floor. And we should make it so that no one is worrying about how they're going to pay for a place to live. No one has to worry about how they're gonna have enough to eat, health care. But just give people enough money to have a reasonable quality of life. One thing that I think every most people get wrong is that if the robots do come take all the jobs, then the cost of living will go down so much that we can afford to do this. And that's not what we're interested in studying. I'm not interested in the economic question because I'm so confident that if we do have mass technological unemployment, we'll have plenty of money to redistribute. The question is, what makes people happy? What makes people fulfilled? I you know, as much as people complain about their jobs, most people get a lot of satisfaction. And how do you well, what will the new society look like in a world where we do just give everyone enough money to live on, where we don't have this this need to work to survive? And I think I think we'll again, we'll find answers to this. And and people will find new things. It may look really different from work in the way we think of it today where you work to sort of earn a wage. But I think it's really important we figure this out because peep people wanna contribute. They want to they wanna have a say in the future. They wanna have something to do. One of the things that I have found quite inspiring is I've talked to a lot of lower income people, people who are not traditionally part of the Silicon Valley elite in any way, is most of them don't want a handout. Most of them want to find meaningful work and a job. How did you pick those initial 500 families? Well, I I hope it turns out to be a good program, but at a minimum, success would look like getting good data and running a a good, thoughtful experiment where people can look at this and say, this policy makes sense or it doesn't. But here's this experiment that leaders in the field agree is well designed and well run. And here's what happened. People were net happier, net healthier, less happy. People were able to retrain themselves. People were able to find new work. Are are folks going in for weekly tests? Or what kind of measurements? Keep it fairly hands off. But there's like a monthly sort of survey. And it kind of is run very hands off from the rest of YC. gotten much more press attention than we ever thought. We're doing this thing. It's working really well. But it's gonna cause this massive effect on everybody. And how can we be sort of responsible citizens of the world? And, you know, universal basic income is not an idea that we're the only fans of. One of the things that has surprised me about the idea is how broad the support is from such different people. But, you know, we're in a place where we can actually study it. People have been talking about it for a long time. But it's sort of people arguing with each other about, well, this would happen or this would happen rather than saying we tried it and this is what happened. So we thought we could contribute and we felt an obligation to contribute to the policy discussions with some actual data. Now, we we've worked we talked to a number of mayors in different cities before picking Oakland, and we wanted and community groups. And we only wanted to do it in a place where we felt the community leaders supported it, were interested in it, wanted it in their community. And we also worked with the Stanford review board since, obviously, we're working with people here. Ultimately, do you think that UBI is something that startups and and investors should be leading or that the government will be leading? Well, I think the government will eventually do it if it turns out to be good policy, but not for a long time. And again, the the issue for me is not not economically as affordable. I believe if we need it, it will be. But this is a mega change to society. Right? Like, we have evolved to struggle to survive, basically, for a long time in different ways. And if you take that away from people, if you take that that sort of need or drive or whatever that is, what's gonna happen? Again, I think it'll be great. I'm I'm optimistic about it. But it is it is a big change, and I think it'd be good if we had some data about how it impacted people before it's hard to say which won't. But in in the short term, I think is likely going to be at least greatly supplemented by machine learning. All is always hard to say. people want a human connection. I think there'll be a lot that, frankly, aren't. And then over time, I expect the definition of repetitive work to keep moving down the field. And and and I think, unfortunately, we will find that a lot of what we do is actually quite repetitive or someone's done it before to some degree. Yeah. it is striking to me how much San Francisco is an incredibly optimistic place in a way that most of the rest of the country isn't. It's also striking to me how much so I think people talk about globalization and technology, they and think about them as the same force. You know? Somehow, like, my job is at risk by this force. And I'm I'm not sure if it's that it's gonna go to China or that a computer's gonna take it, but somehow this thing that I had, there's something that's trying to take it from me. And I think the thing that has surprised me about the current wave of populism, or at least the Trumpism version of it, is people really blame globalization because that was an easier enemy for Trump to talk about or something. It's at least clear to say what to do about that. And automation is actually a completely orthogonal vector. None of the kind of And it didn't mean more than that. I so one thing I try to do is if if I get data that my model of the word world is wrong, then I try to go update my model. And and certainly Trump the whole Trump phenomenon, I had been paying quite a bit of attention to for the last couple of years. And clearly, because I try not to fall into these, like, insular traps. And I was struck by how when I first started this, I didn't know how to go find a 100 Trump voters. And that alone seemed, like, deeply problematic. you know, we're trying to figure out, like, are there a set of statements that we can ask a tech company to commit to? You know, won't turn over user data without without due process. We'll fight sort of unconstitutional illegal orders for user data. We'll protect its immigrant employees. We'll provide money and assistance to people that are running into problems with immigration raids or or at the borders, you know, committing to creating jobs not just in San Francisco, but 100 people have I've talked to about it in different ways. And I think that's a good thing to do. I think, you know, a clear statement of values from tech companies about things that are at risk from current I don't think we've yet figured out what the right thing to do is or even what to call it. It's very hard. It's it's certainly not a tech union. It's it's more like a workers council. You certain I think you want this to come from tech employees because the leverage here is that employees say, I won't work at a company that doesn't commit to support these values. But we just haven't quite figured out the exact right thing to do. I hope I hope we do soon. like, I think that people saying he shouldn't do that is ridiculous. Like, this guy's our president. He's gonna be our president for some time. And we should try to, like, we should all root for his success. Right? And we should all try to change his mind as much as we can. But the the obstructionist thing where you just say, like, anyone who works with him, we're gonna, like, try to destroy, I I think it's just unrealistic. And I think it's not how you know, like there was this backlash is too strong of a word because I've seen actual backlashes and this wasn't one. But there was more sort of just like anti Peter, like everyone needs to cut him out, protest outside of his house, like, Peter's the devil. And, like, this is it it struck me. Like, this was the only one of the very few vocal prominent Trump supporters in Silicon Valley. And although I clearly disagree with his assessment of Trump, I don't think what happened I don't think anyone deserves what happened to him. Like, he and I don't think it was effective for what most people who were opposing him care about, which is if you sort of What happened to him? Just to sort of this, like, constant, like people should be able to support a political candidate and express the reasons they do, especially if they're unpopular, without someone ascribing all of that person's worst traits. So I don't think again, I it's very hard for me to defend Trump. I'm but there are things about him that I think are are right. And, you know, Peter's support of those things, I don't think means people should say, well, you know, Peter hates immigrants. Peter hates Muslims. I I like, I just Yeah. I don't think I think he was willfully mischaracterized there. What are those things that you think are right? Well, I think one big thing that he is right about is or Trump is right about is that a lot of Americans are being left behind. some responsibility for this. But I think we need an economy that has a lot more winners. I think if there's one graph that helped me understand the Trump phenomenon, it was one that shows productivity gains over the last sixty or seventy years Mhmm. Which is a relatively straight line. And then it shows real wage growth adjusted for inflation. And that graph tracks productivity until about 1973 or something and then has completely flatlined since. And so there's this sense that the system has gotten completely rigged and that normal people just don't get ahead anymore. And this was the thing that I heard a lot when I talked to Trump voters that I don't That's what the Trump voters are feeling, but that's not necessarily a Trump policy that he's right about. Like, you know, what what does he Oh, I don't think he's right about how to solve it, identified this thing in a way that other politicians hadn't. And it really did speak to, you know, real pain people are feeling today. And you go to some of these cities There are very few jobs and sort of just absolute despair. And it's clear something has really gone wrong. And I think that Trump is even went to talk about that. He he was right. whose life is not going like this idea of the American dream seems comical to. I think that was really right. Yeah. It's very hard to say, you know, like, the major campaign promises that he ran on that he was going to do in his first hundred days have generally not happened. And so I don't I don't know how to separate campaign rhetoric from what he's likely to do. You know, is he really gonna try to bust up the Silicon Valley companies under antitrust law? Maybe. I don't I don't know. like, less if if we have a harder time bringing in immigrants into the tech industry, that will be out for Silicon Valley. But it's it's it's just really hard to say what he will actually do. Yeah. yeah. I mean, I think that the California governor is a interesting position in terms of someone that can oppose Trump. It's a very powerful counterweight. But Again, this is like a few dinner conversations. This is not like, I don't wanna I I don't wanna, like, characterize this as, like, this is something I was spending a lot of time trying to do. This is like, oh, I think you would be good at this. And I think, you know, you seem kinda bored in your job and I I I think if one thing that Trump showed us is that people are ready for outsiders, I agree with Trump's diagnosis of the problem, which is that the system is rigged and we don't have economic justice. I just don't think he has the right answers or any answers on how to fix that. But if we could get somebody who has run a large successful tech company and thought a lot about how we train people and create jobs, create wealth, and how we make a fairer system. I'm interested in that. I don't think it's in the cards. don't like it when people sort of say, oh, I tried to convince Sam to do this and go jump on him and, like, know, convince him to fund my company or whatever that is. But look, I I hope we will see more engagement, and I hope we will see more people getting into politics. I don't Would you ever run? You know, they the amount of resources that that organization deploys and has been deploying every year for decades is just unbelievable. So you really need someone with, like, many billions of in San Francisco and sort of in progressive communities of just, like, constant negativity and, like, hoping they feel. Mhmm. Like, let's at least do something proactive rather than just complain all the time. Oh, it's it's mostly recently been around politics just because that's been what everybody's talking about. Yeah. facing the country right now, and certainly the Bay Area, is the cost of housing. And And we have seen, in my opinion, a complete failure of state and local governments to build enough housing to fill demand. And thus, people are getting priced out of their homes. And I think it's completely unjust. So right now, you're in the research phase. From what I've read, you're in the research phase and looking for a location to build a city from the ground up. No. Specifically, we're researching now is is there a way if we found land that we could build houses for, like, a $100,000 so that a family, you know, on two x the average national salary, come home from World War two as a young family and buy a house. And And I think what we're interested in researching is, is there a way we can use technology and obviously some policy work to make housing affordable again? Because if we don't solve that, it's just like however much wealth we manage to create just flows to the existing landowners. And that is a real problem. So we're still in the stage of can we figure out a way to make housing super affordable? If we can figure that out, then we'll look for, you know, a place to do this. But it ought to be possible. Like, you know, where where I'm from in Missouri, there's still houses on the outskirts, brand new five bedroom houses on half an acre that sell for, like, $99,000. It's a great question. I we would if again, if we can figure out an answer to the technological questions, which I'm not sure we'll be able to, we would only want to do this in a city or existing community where we could engage with the people that already lived there. I do think tech has been pretty bad at this. I also think the cities have been pretty bad at engaging with tech. You know, I am I I have But I think it would only work if we were able to do it with really good engagement. This actually gets to an another issue of climate, which is anytime there's, like, a two party system of any sort, it becomes super tribal. And so you see this in the current broken political system with the Democrats and the Republicans. And, you know, 50% of people would now object to their children marrying someone of the opposite party. That's the same number, incidentally, that it was for marrying someone of a different race 50 ago. Now that number is below 20%, and political parties have gone from below 20% to 50. And so this this super tribalistic thing that I think sort of, you know, supports fringe behavior is No. My weird hobby is premised on, like, a boyhood survivalist fantasy that I think a lot of other people have. Silicon Valley's view towards ancient cultural values. You know, there there was there's this great book about sort of the values that seem to be shared by all cultures. And and it's there's like a list of 30 something of them. And I I read it a long time ago and then I reread it more recently in the context of how do I think sort of I was more thinking about how software engineers and specifically people working on AI think about this. And it is funny how AI you know, I I always have said that I I like when scientists sort of feel really superior to sort of atheist scientists feel really superior to people who believe in whatever religion they believe in and then try to sort of defend that their beliefs about the Big Bang are any less crazy or any less difficult to wrap your mind around than any other creation story, I think that's always a little bit silly. You know, sure, like, we can test ours, but it feels so disconnected from reality that I think people, no matter how smart they are, no matter how enlightened they think they are, and no matter how rigorous they are in how they try to think about science and technology, fall back to these very basic human cultural values and and sort of needs for explanation that cut across everything. I think direct democracy is an interesting concept worth testing. And I think, you know, there have been a number a number of people have come to see me recently that are planning to, you know, run for some level of office on a direct democracy platform and, you know, like literally vote whatever their constituents vote on every issue. I don't think I know entirely how that's going to work. That's pretty far out of my area of expertise. But I'm I'm interested in the experiment. I think there are these there are these times, though, when the crowd is just wrong. And we've seen this many times in our our nation's history. But, you know, like, the fact that, like, it wasn't that long ago women couldn't vote. It wasn't that long ago that interracial marriage wasn't allowed. And just because a majority of the people think something like that doesn't mean it's right. And so my my worry about direct democracy would be what happens when people are just wrong? And and we have sort of had this system where, sometimes we do elect leaders who do something unpopular but right. there are a lot of people, and we have collectively a lot of power. And we get to choose our leaders in the system. If we aren't civically engaged, if we all sort of say, you know what, that's somebody else's problem, then then we won't get the future we we sort of want and deserve. And I think if we have people saying, you know what, this system is is not fair, We can get outsider leaders. And and that's how things will change. But the system will only be immune to corporate greed or individual greed or any other kind of greed if the principle of democracy of regular people engaging continues. OpenAI is an organization that maybe eight or 10 of us started a little over a year ago. And the idea is that we are on the precipice of the most important technological development maybe ever. And the current path before we started was that it was going to be owned by a small number of corporations. And it was going to be used as they are obligated to do to enrich their shareholders. And this is the thing that, you know, depends how crazy you wanna be about it, but maybe this is something that, like, is the children of humanity someday. But at a minimum, it is technology that is going to generate huge amounts of wealth. And we felt like that deserved to be owned collectively. So we started a nonprofit and saying, you know, this this most important thing, we're gonna build with no obligation to enrich shareholders. And the team's only directive is to have this go maximally well for humanity, figure out how to democratize decisions about it and the benefits of it. We don't want we don't want one company to make all the money, basically, all the money in the world, and also to make all the decisions about how this impacts all of us. So we wanted to build something that we could sort of give to the world as a whole, that we could all participate in, that we could all benefit from. And that is what we do. The other thing is that we worry that AI could go really badly. And that if you do if you if we do actually succeed or if anybody else succeeds and we build something that is a billion times smarter and more powerful than the next smartest, most powerful agent, which would be the smartest, most powerful human, you really wanna think about how that's gonna go. And you really wanna be careful that that doesn't end in the way that many bad sci fi movies have ended. And we wanted an organization dedicated to thinking about how to have that happen safely and well. So that's what we do. Again, I think startups can do a huge range of things. I mentioned, you know, a startup that's taking on nuclear fusion. We funded many companies that are working on solar energy. We funded four or five different companies working on cures for cancer. Think we have funded three companies working directly on cheaper housing and then a whole bunch that are working indirectly on cheaper housing. You know, if you can maybe autonomous cars are actually the secret to cheap cheaper housing, autonomous electric cars, because then you can live further out in of the city and the commute's not so bad. I I think the list of problems in society, unfortunately, just keeps getting longer. And so there are more things than ever before that we need startups to take on. And I think it's a mistake to think you can only build an app. One of the most important insights that I've had about startups is that it is easier to start a hard company than an easy company. If you start the twenty two thousandth photo sharing app, no one will care about you. You know, people will roll their eyes. It'll be hard to get the media to write about you, hard to hire, hard to, you know, just capture the attention of customers. And if you do something that really is important to the world, a lot of people wanna help you. So if you say, hey, I'm trying to, you know, solve clean energy, a lot of people wanna help you. A lot of people wanna invest. The press wants to cover you. You know, a lot of customers are interested in that problem. The government will be interested in trying to help you. And so people I often think it's easier. And people don't try enough because it is sort of risky. It sounds you can start a startup to, you know, try to fix education. Why do we spend three times as much on education in the state that we did in the seventies in real dollars and get worse results? Is throwing more money at the existing system going to make that any better? It hasn't yet. But maybe we can develop an actually good use of technology for teaching, which we haven't done yet. And that would have a huge impact. I was one company that I worked very closely with during Y Combinator a year ago was called Instabug, or is still called Instabug. They're doing really well. They went back to Egypt after Y Combinator. And one of the things I noticed when a partner of mine went there recently is that when you have one successful company come to Silicon Valley and come back, then a lot more people say, oh, I can do that too, and maybe I'll apply to Y Combinator. And we saw a real uptick from that. So I think there are a lot. They're just many of them don't come to the Valley. But I expect that to change over time. It's a great question and one that I am particularly proud to answer. We like the non tracked founders the best. We like I I think one advantage that we have is that we are, I I believe, the most diverse partnership, and we fund the most diverse founders of any any investing arm in Silicon Valley. I'm not this next part is more bad than good. We have five women at sort of the top level of our partnership, like, we have a very diverse set of people. And I think that is reflected in the founders that we fund. And I think this has been a significant edge that we've had over competitive programs and competitive investors. I think that if you don't get a really diverse group of founders, you will miss problems that a lot of the world faces. I spend a huge amount of my time traveling outside of Silicon Valley, both so that I get a sense of problems that different people face and listen to them, but also to meet founders that I wouldn't normally interact with. I think one of the best innovations that Y Combinator ever had is that you don't need an introduction to talk to us, which you needed basically for every investor before we came along. But anyone can come to our website and apply, and we look at that application. And we look at everyone everyone that applies to our program. And this idea that you need this network this networking, this intro, this warm intro as they call it, I think is something that made Silicon Valley super insular. And the idea that we will look at anybody and we try to go speak to anybody has been really great. And I think that is how you make a more inclusive Silicon Valley. And I think if you don't fund a more representative group of founders and and also make them successful, then it'll be very hard to solve the broader diversity problem faced in the rest of Silicon Valley. Like, go to you know, go visit slums in Africa and ask people what what you could do that would help them or what technology they use and and what they'd like to see invented. The I I think it's very easy to get caught up in a very I think anything you can do that helps somebody else is valuable. And I think people are often too dismissive in saying this is not big enough. This doesn't help people who are really poor enough. But I do think it's important to think about, you know, what what can I do that will really impact millions or billions of people's lives who are a lot less fortunate? I think it's easy to say that the world hasn't done enough and the technology industry hasn't done enough. And while I agree with that, I think it's important to also talk about the positive change that has happened. One of my favorite one the graph that I look at when I'm really feeling depressed is the the decrease in global poverty rate in the last forty years. thing that we fund at YC Research is a project that's studying universal health care. to then, if that works, replicate it to larger and larger villages with, you know and we can build something quick for them. And it won't be perfect in the first version, but there are people who desperately need help and and and need technology, need a better life. And I think anything you can do to help with that is a huge thing, no matter how small the scale is that it starts at. And so this is a company that's starting. They're just providing or it's a nonprofit. They're just providing health care for a thousand people, but they're thinking about how they're going to do it for a billion people. And, you know, I think that's that's a great way to think about the world and having an impact. Well, I think we've been talking about that for sixty minutes, but I'll try to answer it. I think, How can we make every person thinking about how can we use technology to make every person in the world happy and healthy and fulfilled and rich enough to be the way I think about this in my own life is I can use this lever of enabling a bunch of entrepreneurs to go do this, and I can have more of an impact than I could taking on any problem myself. So for me, it's how do I find, enable, inspire people to go use technology to solve these problems?
