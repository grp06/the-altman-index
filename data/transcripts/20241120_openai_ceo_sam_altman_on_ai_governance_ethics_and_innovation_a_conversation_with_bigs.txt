Sam Altman: computers was going to be important, but we still really underestimated how much we needed to scale them. Yeah. Too much incredible AI medical advisors, then I I don't I don't know. and ask them what they think about those people of the future's jobs, we'll say, you know, some weird definition of art, but okay. They're making art, and none of them care about money. They have unbelievable material abundance.

I think I think a tight feedback loop and watching where the problems are being created, fixing those, finding the new problems, taxing income and corporate profits primarily is not quite right. One of the things that has worked surprisingly well is the ability to align an AI system to break behave in a particular way. And so if we can articulate what that means in a bunch of different cases, is you could imagine one of these systems chatting with all of its users saying, explain to me your value system, and then I'm gonna collectively align across that. I am a believer that the users of technology, thing that is enabled by this technology that just wasn't possible before. I I I I'm interested in the thought experiment of an AI chats
