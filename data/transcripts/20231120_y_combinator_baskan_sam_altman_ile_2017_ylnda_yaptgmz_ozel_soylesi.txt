Sam Altman: there's a lot of very natural growth for us. And as you just mentioned, is something that I think is really important. I think in general, sort of systems at all levels, people, companies, countries, they're either kind of growing or dying. One of the challenges, I'd say, that we face is that a lot of founders in other markets think they're not good enough to compete with The US startups. So I say, well, you know, what's different about startups in my country? What's not as good about startups in my country? And there's this feeling that I usually start my talks by saying you have to just get over this, that people aren't good enough to compete with, you know, the big league in Silicon Valley. That's just ridiculous, but it is something that comes up again and again and again.
Unknown: Yeah, and I actually want to ask you,
Sam Altman: anyone anywhere in the world can compete with anybody else. And I think people should not limit themselves to saying, we're gonna just, you know, play in our little sandbox. And I think over time, that knowledge, that network will just sort of spread and diffuse.
Unknown: because some people already believe that it's here because of the techno blockchain technology and ICOs and everything. And
Sam Altman: a lot of our lives are pretty safe. And yes, there are downsides. Of these are perfect organizations. I think there's always a natural tension between wanting more regulation and wanting more innovation. And that is going to have socioeconomic effects in ways that are going to be massive but difficult to predict. I don't know what the right answer is, but I think we should be having conversations about a lot. So is it basic income? Is it a robot tax? I don't know. There's dozens of other credible ideas. But I do know that we should be taking this seriously
Unknown: an increasing number of AI startups are joining Y Combinator,
Sam Altman: And so it's different for each start up. A general thing that I would say, one of the most counter intuitive things I've noticed about start ups is it is easier to start a hard company than an easy company. You know, you're making another photo sharing app, there's a lot of people doing it, it's hard to get people really excited. If you're like, we're gonna cure cancer, we're gonna solve nuclear fusion,
Unknown: a more widespread cultural change in the valley, which just brings
Sam Altman: are one of the key solutions to this problem. And and certainly, you know, we put up a website called Female Founder Stories where we highlighted some of our most successful female founders. And as I've been around on tours, many young women have said, hey, I was like, not sure I could start a start up. And I saw this woman, and I was like, I saw myself in there, and I saw that I can do that. So I think highlighting women as successful founders is a really great thing to do. One of the things that we have six female GPs here and one of the things they say is that they get frustrated when the press asks them only what is it like to be a woman in technology, woman in venture capital. Not just asking them, what do you think about the blockchain? What do you think about AI? What do you think about biotech? And the men always get asked, what do you think about AI? What do you think about blockchain? What do think about biotech? So They express a lot of frustration about that. But when we highlight them, or when other journalists highlight them just as incredibly competent, successful founders, We hear again and again how much that inspires the next generation. So we're trying to do more of that. I think that's they believe something I don't believe. But I think, you know, we'll continue to try to make whatever efforts we can to improve it.
