Unknown: Of the people that are using it, what's the average number of questions that have been posted on it so far? Average number of questions, what do mean by that? Yeah, so people or requests or something else that they're voting on. Do you know of the 25 paying customers, how many on average have had questions posted?
Sam Altman: Know, like, there's all these different reasons people like it. It's really nice if you can figure out how that all abstracts into one message and then build all of the company's sales and marketing and PR around. so when you say you have a problem with people integrating you, it's not that hard. It's just not high enough on their priority list. There's a few ways to solve this. One thing that works is to send people around and say like, hey, we're gonna send an engineer to come help integrate with you. And it's not that the company can't do it, it's just that like, otherwise you'll always be at the bottom of their backlog. Right. And that's one way. The other is if it's like, their CEO tells them to go do it. Or like, they themselves decide, I gotta go do this, it's really important. And that almost never comes from a bunch of disparate messages that are a bunch of nice to haves. It's like one thing, which is maybe in this case like, means it's some version of like user feedback and how if you don't have this, you will be iterating more slowly than your competitors.
Unknown: Or that your users will feel like you're more engaged with them if listening to the features that they want built. I
Sam Altman: I worry that this is the kind of business where if you're mostly selling to startups, and you're selling it, let's say on average a $100, is it a month or a year? A month. A month. Like how big can this business actually get off of this model?
Unknown: But do you feel there's a 100,000 stuff? So part of it is like, do you feel you're gonna have to own like 50% of the startup market to get there? Or do you think there's enough demand out there that you can actually get to the market without being dominating
Sam Altman: feels like the kind of service that is interchangeable. And that a lot of people can build a similar service. If one company uses product A and another company uses product B, there's no reason for a third company to prefer a or b. There's no network effect. There's no monopoly. where there are sort of cross company incentives to use yours. But what is your plan to be a monopoly and not another SaaS business that just gets competed down to zero margins? It's a good question.
Unknown: And it may be true that you are, I believe that it is, but someone else can come do that same thing to you. More importantly, or not necessarily more importantly, but oftentimes you start off very simple, and then you start having to build features because you see that they're missing. And then somebody else comes in and says, we're now the simplest. But in any case,
Sam Altman: part of that, you know, when the one thing you should be thinking about is what can I do early to build a product that a, can eventually address a very large market, and b, how can I build some sort of there's some way that you can like use aggregated data or learnings across all companies. Mhmm. Or aggregate, you know, like share like users. The kind of users that leave feedback on products tend to do it across all the products they build. They use. So there's probably like a very small percentage of users that give feedback and they do it across all the products. So my sense is that somewhere in there, there is a strategy to build
Unknown: Would they pay you? No, you would pay them to, like you would do a rev share with them, right? Correct. So essentially,
Sam Altman: no one ever want, like you're putting this product of yourself out there when you launch a startup and no one wants to do it until they feel like it's really Speed and execution really matter. And it actually, you could tell 10,000,000 people the idea. And probably all of them would be busy with their own things. But a few of them will be interested at least. And there's this issue of speed and how quickly you can build and iterate. And especially in a marketplace, there is a big first mover advantage. So even if it's not the version you want, my most important piece of advice to you would be to get this launched really quickly in an ugly first version. And then you'll learn so much about how to build a better version that you can go from there. It's great that you're talking to customers. That is clearly the number And one thing to go getting people signed up so that you have inventory. But I would think about how you bring the launch in, even if it's a soft launch that you're embarrassed about by a lot. Yeah,
Unknown: especially if the problem is acute enough, if it's something that people really struggle with, finding parking spots, they won't care how pretty the app is or how ugly the app is, as long as they can find the parking spots. So having something live, even if it's just like a website wrapped in a You little know, it's like if Yeah. That's literally what we're doing is we're targeting certain neighborhoods. So for instance,
Sam Altman: That drive to the city every day and have to park or live in the city and don't have a parking place. That does not strike me as the most urgent need or the best way to find people who are The festival thing, worry there aren't enough festivals and there aren't enough people at those that have this as a regular ongoing problem. You
Unknown: Maybe laminated or whatnot to put it on those places where it needs to be. Right. You need something that in a lot of cases it is an impulse buy, right? They are going to be looking for parking, they didn't find the street parking and now they're ready to buy whatever it is that you're giving them. Yeah. I have a general thought for you about this kind of marketplace.
Sam Altman: Airbnb is a really good business because if you own a space and you're renting it out, you can only put it on basically one platform if you're going to use the instant book feature. And if you're a guest, you really care if you get this particular house or this particular house. They're not interchangeable. Ride sharing, if you're a driver, can drive for any service. You turn the apps on and off. If you're a passenger, you don't care much which car you get in. And it's really nice if you can somehow have the former kind of marketplace, where there's not just perfect substitution and everyone is switching between each service depending on price. And so if you can do something with, I think this is like actually a very big and important insight about marketplaces that most people miss. And if you can do something where people can only list their space on your marketplace because you're gonna have around the clock instant booking or something, that would be really important to figure out early. And a very valuable tweak that doesn't sound
Unknown: Because I was thinking that this is more around homeowners or people who have extra spaces on their own. But businesses could be really interesting. It's a very different sale now because now you really have to go and convince whoever the property manager is or somebody else to actually Correct. Do would
Sam Altman: If you don't move fast, it won't work. So, I I think it's always important as a startup to know what the number one biggest problem in front of you is. For you, it's like not shipping quickly. And so, get this working in one neighborhood as quickly as you possibly can, even if it's like hacked up and doesn't look that great. Okay. Any other questions you wanna discuss?
Unknown: There's been a variety of them. Some of them have been like friends of friends that heard that we were doing contract work and would come in and like assign jobs through there. Another Another thing is when we shut down our last company, we open sourced all the code. And so we had people coming in and like paying us to deploy that code for them on their own servers. They found us through GitHub basically. What kind of projects are people having you build so far? So the contractors set their own rates, and then we're handling the invoicing and charging 15% on top of that.
Sam Altman: how will you become the marketplace where everyone goes for
Unknown: contracted engineering help? I think we can speak from our own experience and say like there have been times in the past when we had student loans and would have worked extra time every week to pay them off. And there's not really marketplaces out there where people who want over 50 or $70 per hour can find like short term projects that they can do on the side. So that that's true on the developer side, but how do you get the companies to come to you and say, when we need an expert, we go to you guys? We're working on a couple different ways of matching, but I think the short of it is that there are very specialized needs that some companies have. And it doesn't even have to be core to the product. Sometimes it's like, I need to set up a development environment or I want a landing page and our design team is focused on an app or something like that. I wonder if you wanna become known as the act like, the place to go to for a particular set of skills. Not for every expertise, but in the beginning, just like a particular set where they just go to you and then you open up additional verticals as you go. And for that, we're looking at open source projects. So like an open source project is something where it takes a lot of knowledge, a lot of experience to kind of understand the ins and the outs. And so we tested that with our own open source projects and got projects coming through there and people signing up. And I think that matching people based on very specific open source projects. Not saying like, you know, a Ruby programming language, but something like the MongoDB bindings for Chef for something very specific like that.
Sam Altman: Think the insight of going after high end work and also for people who are just looking for smaller pieces is really good. I wonder if you could pick projects that particularly need that. Like projects that are harder to build and take less time, sort of need specialized skills and are not the normal, like, I just need people to grind through this. That would strike me as a good initial focus.
Unknown: to 200 per hour. The the interesting thing is that it's not so much how much the people are charging. It's more the perceived value on the other companies. Right? So if the company is saying that these developers are worth a 150 or $200 an hour, they don't actually, like they they're happy to pay that. But you need to convince them that they're worth that money regardless of what the developers think they're worth. Mhmm. And how how do you do that? How do you convince a company that your developers are worth $200 an hour if they can go somewhere for $25 an hour? Yeah. And I think right now for the MVP, what we're trying to say is like we are personally experts in these fields and we are making sure that the quality of talent we have is up to that par.
Sam Altman: In terms of setting the prices, one thing we have consistently seen is when you ask a user to set their prices in the marketplace. If you give them guidance, if you say like based off what you've said, here's what you recommend or here's the range you recommend, 85, 90% of users will do that. And so if you want to set, if you wanna sort of move people towards a specific range because you want people that are at that quality level,
Unknown: you can probably do that. So we did that. Our sign up form says the average hourly rate is $70 per hour and it also says if you have your monthly or sorry, if you have your annual salary,
Unknown: external developer live? Right? So that's not the two of you. So we're working on basically building out invoicing
Unknown: Do you need invoice? Like, can you do it more manually in the beginning? Just so that you can see someone who's not you. Because you're you obviously don't have invoicing. Right? So we've been doing this ourselves, and there's just a lot of moving parts. There's, like, sending contracts back and forth. There's, like, setting up bank accounts. There's getting companies to pay. And when we talk to the potential contractors who wanna be on the platform, some of their biggest concerns are, like, if I'm only working ten hours per week, how much time does it take to ramp up? Like, do I need to talk with the customer? And how long does it take until I get paid?
Unknown: developing. Take all of the pressure away from them so that they can just start interacting with the customer. And if you need to manually process it, do that. But it's so important that someone who's not you starts doing this on your platform.
Sam Altman: many of which will surprise you and your guesses on many will be wrong. And the way you find this out is to just like, for the first, let's say 20 users,
Unknown: like go sit with them or at least go talk to them all the time. I would almost think about it like become their agent, right? Like if they were a talent and you were an agent for them and you take care of everything for them and answer all their questions.
Sam Altman: And then you can just start building that into the product. But in our experience, almost every time when people think they know like where the break points are going to be or what they need to teach their users, they're almost always wrong. But you find it out really quickly. It's like, you don't need a giant sample set to start hearing the common concerns people have at every stage in the process. And then you just knock those off one at a time. And that is a way I think you can differentiate from other coding talent marketplaces that don't do this. And if you can figure out,
Unknown: One of the other, just an idea which you may or may not want to pursue, but if you want to be known as the experts in the field, see if you can get any experts to actually use your platform, right, through your network or somewhere else. Get someone who's well known on a particular niche area and have them sign up on your platform and do projects on your platform, if they're willing to. Yeah.
Unknown: like, if we were to manually take payments, we're using Stripe Connect which handles everything including like the ten ninety nines. But there's no like turnkey invoicing system built on top of that right now. Yeah, I
Unknown: get that. I really do get that. But I still feel like it's so, I get that feeling as a developer all the time. It's like if only I have this built, I'd be ready to go. But it's so much more important to actually find out if you can, like even if you have the platform built, there's a chance that people won't start using it. And you'll only know that when you do the non scalable things. That's one of the things that we drive home almost every single office hour session, which is just do the non scalable things. Do it manually. Don't worry about ten months down the road. Ten months down the road, it's a new company. Right, it will look very different than it is today. But today, it's so important to just do the non scalable things. And we're just talking about a small handful of users. Don't have Everyone's to bring
Sam Altman: It's a war it's a slightly warring instinct to say that like, my biggest problem is that I haven't built this one piece of the software yet. Not not that my biggest problem is how I'm gonna get those 2,000 users. So often we've seen the idea of, I'm gonna get these great developers to sort of build stuff for other people. And it has been so hard to actually do that because reasons that people have thought they're going to get the developers or the sort of assumptions in developers know how to do this well have just been so wrong. And so you still don't have like, there's something fundamental about the model that's going to change. But getting people you don't know or you don't know well to sort of build projects on the platform,
Unknown: the time to go hire people. And we started hiring part time people, people who were like friends of friends, things like that. And so we started to do a lot of like first hand research like that. No, I I think that's great. That's actually super important because it means you have the pain and you understand the pain. But it's still
Unknown: Sam and I are just kinda driving to the same thing which is just, it's so critical to get someone who has nothing to do with your previous business or your current kinda core business that wants to start using it.
