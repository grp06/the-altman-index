You can email people you already know and you can ask them to be your customers. You can call in all the favors with anyone you can think of, someone you took a random class with, someone you were friends with in high school. So if it's a paid product, charge them. Another strategy is to research people that you think might use your product, And then email them or whatever and ask them to try it. Conversion rates here are low, maybe 2%, 3%, so you'll have to do this to more. But you can send targeted emails and say, hey, I just made this new product. I'd really appreciate if you would try it out. Most people wanna be helpful, they probably will. You can do social media, hacker news, forums, press, whatever. If this is going to be your growth strategy, you need to figure out a way for it to be ongoing. Not a one big pop and then go away. Most people who do this No, but I really need users. Will you please write? The journalist still says no. Airbnb is an example of a company that made this work as an ongoing process. You know, they would do the craziest things. They just kept coming up with press after press stunt. They would mail journalists giant boxes of cereals that they got on their desk. And they were able to get it to keep going. But that's hard. And finally, the laziest and least impressive thing you can do is to just buy ads on Facebook or Google and point people to your website.
