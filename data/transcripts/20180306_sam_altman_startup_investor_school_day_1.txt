Sam Altman: People that are doing things for the first time are willing to do things that anyone who has got a few more battle scars won't try and that is incredibly energizing to be around. for the same reason slot machines are so satisfying, I think this is a very common mistake that people make when they start investing. You get very swayed by what previously successful investors think. I would say 80% of investors outsource 80% of their decision making to what other people think about an investment opportunity. the magnitude of your biggest success. It is not about the failure rate. Most investors talk about their failure rate. Still, you know, when we have people that are trying to build angel firms come talk, the the question the first question they ask is what is your failure rate? What's an acceptable failure rate? Totally the wrong question. Totally the wrong way to think about angel investing. You can have 95% It's not what could go wrong. The first question is how big could this be if it works? Can I imagine this founder, this idea, this market supporting a, you know, massive, massive company? And because they sound like a bad idea, the best investments are the ones that are easiest to talk yourself out of if you start off thinking about why they could go wrong. handful of companies that get started every decade that are responsible for almost all of the returns? Just to put some numbers on the power law, YC has funded I think around 1,600 companies, maybe 1,700. Our top five companies represent about two thirds of the value that we've created. Another thing that I think is surprising is many of these companies that are sort of a generation defining companies are started by people who are This is part of what we try to do at YC is we try to get our founders to like us so much that they refer all of their friends to us And we this idea of like word-of-mouth as the way to find companies to invest in has been great. If you're just starting out, I think what I have seen the most successful angel investors do is just start helping founders for free, realizing they may not get to invest in those companies but that they'll get the referrals down the road. And so much of this is about people connecting you to other people that you don't know. And we just make it really clear. Anyone in the world can go to our website, click apply. We try to respond to emails to people that email us. We take people seriously that have no personal brand, no reputation, no network. We ask people that are in our network to connect us to the most promising people they know that we don't already know. But this idea that we're available and we're open, I think this was in the '2 or three most important secrets of YC. This was something that we did that was really different. Other people hadn't done it before. In fact, people bragged about the opposite. And we went totally the other direction, and I strongly recommend this. Be open to that random email that comes in. So one big shift that's happened in the last ten years I'd say or maybe fifteen even is there are now way more people that want to invest in good startups than there are good startups. And so founders have really become in the driver's seat. Founders and founders talk a lot now. The network has gotten big enough that the asymmetry that used to exist where investors had a lot of leverage is gone, and I don't think it will come back anytime soon. Your reputation matters a lot. It is way more important to your future success as an investor that founders like you and say, that investor did the right thing by me, than it is that you squeeze out, you know, a few drops of juice from a failing company. The number of investors that I have seen do incredible long term damage to their reputation by fighting over the carcass of a company that was never, because of the power law, going to matter to them anyway, but try to get out $10,000 or whatever from a dying company, If you're playing the long game, that's not worth it. Reputation, especially reputation when a company is going badly, is super, super important. And I think that is the secret at this point in sort of 2018 Silicon Valley to to winning deals. The thing that we tell founders to do and the thing that founders do anyway when they're trying to choose between a number of investors that all wanna invest in their company is they they do reference checks on you just like you do on them. And more and more, the thing that I have seen founders use as the criteria to make the decision about which investors to work with is what the other founders that investor is funded have to say. And so I think this will this will continue to be important. There are other things you can do. Think helping before you close the deal is good. Deciding quickly, being clear about your reasoning, being responsive, being available, all the things you want from a founder, those all help too. But but this reputation of being good to work with, We recently had a company. They had, let's say, you know, 10 investors that were going to join their seed round. Every one of the 10 had said, well, unlike all those other investors, I really do work super hard. I'm the only investor in a round that usually gets advisor shares, so you need to give them to participate. And everybody asked for this. All 10, same thing. I'm the only one. I need advisor shares. And I think, The very best investments I've made have either been a ridiculous deal because no one else wanted to invest or a deal that felt incredibly expensive. The more I was willing to sort of overpay in my mind to invest in a company, often the better it did. And especially when I felt like I was getting screwed. If it was like a huge up round three months after some other round, it was painful. I did it anyway. I think because the companies that work sometimes work so fast and you're anchored to like what a fair deal is, you got to watch out for this. But my experience investing in startups is my best investments with one or two exceptions have been the deals that felt the most expensive to me. And the one or two exceptions were companies where I understood something that no one else did and thus there was no competition whatsoever. Other than that, the companies where I tried to value invest I will consider anything that I believe could be a $10,000,000,000 company, There are other investors who have this like, oh, I only do this one thing at this one stage, companies, the companies that are in that number one spot on the power law are so rare that I suggest you only select for things that can be there and other than that, be really open minded. Speaking of the really big companies, I think I don't know if this was always true. I suspect it may have been. But I think today, it is easier to start a hard company than an easy company. And this sounds super counterintuitive, but if you're gonna build a really big company, you gotta convince people to come work with you, to pay attention to you, to write press articles about you, to care about you, to advise you. And if you are starting the twenty two thousandth photo sharing application, it's really hard. If you are starting a nuclear fusion company, a lot of people want to help with that. And I think especially for the companies that end up breaking out, this is really important. You know, this thing that is so interesting, people proactively want to help you for free, want to come be part of your team, whatever. This is something to look for. So like, is this a company that I believe will be able to recruit hundreds of really talented people who could otherwise start their own companies? to hear an idea at the very early stage and say, yeah, this idea has what it takes to be a $10,000,000,000 company. You can say an idea doesn't have it, which we'll talk about, but it's difficult to say this is for sure the big idea. However, Paul Buchheit, one of our partners, made a list of the four traits that he thought founders that go on to create giant companies have, and they are obsession, focus, frugality, and love. He said this sort of in passing in a meeting like two or three years ago. I've thought about it a lot since. intelligence is really important. You can give a founder an idea and they can start a company. The problem is they need to come up with new ideas for a company. Basically, like, every week, you have to come up with crazy new ideas, big changes all the time. We we tried an experiment once at YC where we funded 20 teams of strong founders that didn't have ideas but were otherwise really good. And what we learned, they all failed. And what we learned is that the good founders are the people that have ideas all the time. So there's an intelligence component to this. There's a creativity component to this. There is an ability to think independent thoughts component to this. But whatever you want to call this, this idea of this particular kind of intelligence that leads to seeing problems in different ways and thinking of ideas that don't yet exist but should, you've got to have that in a founder. founder qualifications that people don't think about enough. So so much of your job as a founder is about communication. You are every time you hire someone, every time you go raise money, every time you try to sell the product, every time you try and set a direction for the company. You do it. Like, a huge amount of a founder's job is being an evangelist for the company. Think about there there are obviously famous exceptions to this, but if you think about it on the whole, the founders of the really super successful companies tend to be great communicators. but and we talk about this a lot, the need to sort of relentlessly execute as a founder. So one way we test this during YC is between office hours, which we have every week or ten days, how much progress do the founders make? How quickly do they take a new idea and try it and say, hey, I came back and I tried that. is incredibly predictive of success. And then there are these people who just like get an amazing amount of stuff done. Their iteration speed, the speed with which they can generate And, you know, like humans always underestimate exponential growth. We're not we're not well evolved for that. And so if you notice a founder who is improving incredibly quickly over the couple of months you get to know that founder, pay a lot of attention. Again, you won't you won't get Brian Chesky in a first meeting, but you can find people who are on a trajectory to develop into a Brian Chesky. And that is super valuable. So starting a startup is a very long term commitment. And unfortunately, it's just not. So as startups have become the new default career trajectory for ambitious people, there are a lot of people who are doing a startup as a resume item or as a way to get rich quickly. This does not work. The amount of pain that you have to suffer for a startup, you realize at some point, you know what? I can do pretty well in any series of other jobs with much less risk and much less negative effect on my life. So you really do want to stay focused on the mission driven founders. And then another way I used to get tricked a lot is there were founders that I didn't think were that good, but they had stumbled on a nice business is really important. I talked a little bit about this, but we have a word at YC called seamsters. This is different than people who just want to make a lot of money. There are an increasing number of people who just And this is obviously ridiculous on its face. Right? Like, if you think about the biggest companies today, ten years ago, many of those markets did not exist. If you think about the size of the social networking market when Facebook started, you think about the size of ride sharing apps when Uber started, that's a really bad metric. And unfortunately, it has become dogma among investors that, you know, size of the market is the most important thing. Even really good investors say this. Big companies are doing that. Second of all, you don't get to surf this wave of this new technological change that pulls startups along and creates a ton of value in a short period of time. But you should prefer a small market growing super quickly to a very large market today. Super counterintuitive. If you chase the things that worked in the last set of companies which is what most investors do, Facebook works. They all want to fund more social networks. but more difficult if you can identify the next rapidly growing market and invest there. This is where this is where independent thought is really important. One way that I like to do this, one way that I like to say, you know, is the market growing really quickly, is to think about this question of whether something is a real trend or a fake trend. Okay. So it has almost become a joke to make fun of angel investors moving like a school of fish after one, Investors Okay. But how do you differentiate between a real trend and a fake trend? A real trend is one where although not that many people are participating yet, the people who are use the platform a lot every day and tell their friends spontaneously how great it is. So when the iPhone came out, It was absolutely life changing. So even though the number of people that had it were small, you could identify that as a real trend because the people who had it were not only like daily active users but hourly active users. And they were they were the best free advertising Apple could ever have hoped for because they told everyone like, this is the future. You've got to buy it. If you contrast that to something like I've to pick on somebody. I'll pick virtual reality. they don't use them every hour. They don't use them every day. Most of them don't use them every week. They sit on shelves. That has clearly not become a real trend platform yet. It may in the future. And the point at which, certainly not all, but most of the biggest technology companies get created soon after one of these massive platform shifts. Sequoia says this thing that I've always liked, which is you cannot create a technology wave. That is well beyond the capability of a small company to do, but you can surf one if you can find the wave. And I think that's really important. And I think it's actually, if you use this framework, pretty reasonable to evaluate. These are things that you can articulate. Unfortunately, what most people end up chasing are bad ideas that look like good ideas. I would say this is where like 90% of all angel capital in the startup ecosystem goes. So this is something that is worth trying to avoid. And the one very common way that people make this mistake, bad ideas that look like good ideas, be very skeptical. If you find yourself tempted to invest in one company where there's hundreds of others working on the same thing, be very skeptical. If you find yourself tempted to work on something that the founders worked super hard to convince you is not gonna be a long term commodity, be very skeptical. The more people talk about like, it is absolutely true that you want something that has real pricing power that comes from a network effect, a moat, a barrier to entry, whatever it is. But the more founders try to like, when that's true, it's so obvious that the more founders try to sell you on why they're super differentiated and why they have this long term competitive advantage, the more skeptical you should be. But I have found this framework just trying to think about is this a good idea that seems bad or is this a bad idea that seems good? I found that has helped me make good decisions a bunch of times. The the best companies all have great products. Unfortunately, the current fashion in Silicon Valley I think has gone a little bit too away from this and it's too much about growth hacking and sales and marketing machines and everything else. And that does work for a while. You know, you can get away, actually for a pretty long while, by executing really well to grow a mediocre product. But you don't usually create like a Facebook sized company by doing that. And I think asking the companies often won't have a great product by the time you're making an angel investment. But if you don't believe they won't get there at some point, I don't think it'll be a huge company most of the time. And here is the very simple framework I use for this. If I think about all of the most successful internet mobile startups, I heard about those becau this is like true for enterprise and consumer apps. I heard about those because they were so good that one of my friends spontaneously told me about it. They were not being incentivized to. That was not they didn't market to me. They didn't advertise to me. It was just like someone I trusted said, you gotta try this new thing. It's amazing. And We clearly had no evolutionary need for this. We can visualize linear growth very well. We can you know, visualize the trajectory of an arrow very well. let's say 25% monthly growth, 1.25 to the thirty sixth power is. It's like where will this company be in thirty six months? It's really hard. And it is how these companies get super valuable. So I long ago learned to stop trying to trust my intuition on this. There are a whole bunch of words, a whole bunch of different ways that people talk about this. This is one of the most important concepts in startup investing. This is one of the things that differentiates investing in startups from investing in small businesses. You are looking for a company that gets more powerful as it gets bigger. And you know this is often fairly obvious. Almost all of the value in a startup is the, you know, revenue, the earnings it's gonna generate in years ten, eleven, and twelve from now. And so if you can't answer this, And then finally, There can be a lot of answers to this, but this this comes back to not basing your decision too much off the decision of other investors. I like to under like, I I don't feel like I have any competitive edge in the in in that particular investment decision. But So helping them find really good people, help them interview. You know, back when I was sort of an active angel investor before YC, Help with future fundraising and then help with just sort of like So super availability for tactical advice, I think, is good. What flaws are acceptable in a founder at a, you know, seed or series a stage? A lot. I think, like, don't compromise on the things that don't get better. Like, don't don't compromise on founder integrity. But if you think the founder's improving fast, I think I think a lot. So I I like I bucket this as traits that I believe can change and traits that I believe can't. And if the founder's improving quickly and it's something that I think is changeable, You know, we've had many, many very unsophisticated founders but that were smart and wanted to learn and were, you know, doing this for the right reasons, super mission oriented, come through this door, these doors, had no domain specific knowledge about Like one funny thing is when you are negotiating an investment, Results based observations about when to exercise pro rata and when not to. Several venture firms have done very sophisticated studies of this and they have all come to the following conclusion, which is if the company is raising an up round led by a good VC, say a top quartile VC, you should always exercise pro rata. there are some incredibly important ICOs happening right now, but they are dwarfed by the number of sort of things that are between just incompetence and scams. However, I do think that it's possible that we just find a much better mechanical way to track the investments we do right now. So that's possible. A bad idea that seemed sorry. A good idea that seemed like And that is really hard. Right? Because you don't you don't have a sense for exactly how big the market is because it's growing so quickly. I think one thing you can do is look at like shifts in consumer behavior that are creating new markets. So like if you thought of Uber as a replacement for booking limo services, Where I've seen that go wrong the most often is then the ability to attract, evaluate, and retain technical talent. Because this is all about the power law, we are always willing to consider exceptions. So I would never answer a question like that and say I would never, but I would try to be clear like, here's what I've seen work more often. So that's Because if you don't and if you're like if the founder is difficult to work with or doesn't listen or you're just not excited about the business, a, that's probably a red flag for their qualities as a founder. And b, you then you won't spend time and you won't help them and you won't get this differentiated thing. So I and that has has always worked pretty well for me. Alright. Thank you all very much.
