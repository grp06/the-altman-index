# Documentation Index

Legacy PRDs and how-to guides have been consolidated into two files at the repo root:

- [`README.md`](../README.md) – setup instructions, architecture overview, and troubleshooting tips.
- [`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md) – active backlog of unimplemented features.

This placeholder exists so the `docs/` directory remains available for future deep-dives or diagrams. Add new references here only when they supplement (not duplicate) the main README/roadmap.
